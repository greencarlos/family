  HOW TO ASK YOUR MATE<br />
  TO MEET YOUR NEEDS</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e5134">You cannot hope to get what you need—whether it be love or respect—by withholding what your spouse needs most. But while you are trying to meet your spouse’s needs, what happens during those moments when your needs are not being met? Must the Energizing Cycle sputter as the Crazy Cycle starts to turn? Must you remain mute, hoping your mate senses your deflating spirit and realizes exactly what is wrong? One of the basic skills I have been trying to teach husbands and wives in this book is how to communicate their needs to each other. Here are some “need communicators” husbands and wives can use to let each other know how they are feeling.</p>

  <p class="h3l" id="d12e5136"><b><i>Wives can humbly and softly say:</i></b></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5140"><b><i>C</i></b>loseness: “When you want to work in your shop all evening and not be with me, that feels unloving. You have a right to your hobbies, but I need some face-to-face time with you too.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5145"><b><i>O</i></b>penness: “When you said you didn’t want to spend time talking about my concerns, that felt unloving to me. I know we don’t always have time to talk at length, but sometimes I need to feel reassured that everything is okay.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5150"><b><i>U</i></b>nderstanding: “When you gave me a quick solution to what I was trying to tell you, that felt unloving. I know you were trying to be helpful, but I really need to feel your care and you can do that by just listening and understanding.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5155"><b><i>P</i></b>eacemaking: “When you tell me to, ‘Drop it, let’s forget it, it’s over,’ that feels unloving. I know some things need forgetting, but first I need to know that you aren’t angry anymore and that we really are at peace.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5160"><b><i>L</i></b>oyalty: “When you look at other women, that feels unloving to me. I know temptations are real, but I need to know you have eyes only for me.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5165"><b><i>E</i></b>steem: “When you make negative comments about my mothering or homemaking, that feels unloving. I know I’m not perfect and that I fail, but I need to hear from you when I do a good job, and I need your encouragement even when I don’t.”</p>

  <p class="h3l" id="d12e5170"><b><i>Husbands can humbly and softly say:</i></b></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5174"><b><i>C</i></b>onquest: “When you make negative remarks about my work goals, that feels disrespectful. I struggle with balancing work and family, and I am not against our family or you.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5180"><b><i>H</i></b>ierarchy: “When you suggest that I am irresponsible, that feels disrespectful. I admit I blow it at times, but overall I am a good provider and protector, and what you’re saying hurts.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5185"><b><i>A</i></b>uthority: “When you make decisions regarding the children that exclude me, that feels disrespectful and I even feel insignificant. Please include me even in the day-to-day stuff whenever you can.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5190"><b><i>I</i></b>nsight: “When you roll your eyes and say, ‘That’s really ridiculous,’ that feels disrespectful. I know you have intuition in many areas, but I have insight that can often help.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5195"><b><i>R</i></b>elationship: “When you refused to go to the basketball game with me, that felt disrespectful. I know you cannot always go to events with me because of the kids, but I need you to be with me as my friend, and lately that’s lacking.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e5200"><b><i>S</i></b>exuality: “When you said you were just too tired to have sex, that felt disrespectful to me. I understand that you’re tired, but I hope you understand my need as well. It’s not that I’m just oversexed; I really need to hold you close.”</p>
