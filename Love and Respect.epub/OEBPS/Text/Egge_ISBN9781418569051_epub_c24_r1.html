  PEACEMAKING—SHE WANTS<br />
  YOU TO SAY, “I’M SORRY”</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2643"><span class="dcap" id="d12e2644">W</span>hile in graduate school, I took a class that involved quite a bit of discussion of conceptual frameworks for certain ideas. There were only two or three of us men in the class—the rest were women, and all of them were feminists. One day the word <i>connectivity</i> came up for discussion. I noticed that the women literally brightened up, and a surge of energy seemed to run through the room. I addressed a question to the ladies: “What is connectivity to you?” They paused. They rummaged about a bit and then said things like, “Well, it’s to connect . . . to be one . . . to be soul mates.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2650">That was good for a start, but I wanted to know more. “Could you give me a working definition of this? After all, we’re all working on PhDs here. We need to be able to discuss and define this in specific terms.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2652">None of the women could. They admitted, “We can’t. We just know when it is present and we know when it’s not.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2654">“I see,” I said. Of course, I didn’t see but we had to move on to the next concept.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2656">I never forgot that discussion, and I continued to work on defining <i>connectivity</i> as I entered the pastorate and especially as I began counseling married couples. Eventually, I came to a much better understanding of connectivity as I created the C-O-U-P-L-E acronym. As we have already seen in these chapters, there are many sides to connectivity. We have already looked at closeness, openness, and understanding. Obviously, all of these have a bearing on how connected a wife feels with her husband.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2661">There is a fourth side to connectivity that we need to look at very carefully—<b><i>P</i></b>eacemaking. In some ways, it might be most important. If there is a rift, a conflict, even a sense of tension, you and your wife are not fully at peace, and, therefore, you can’t really feel connected. Without peace in your relationship, she doesn’t feel close, she doesn’t feel you’re open, and she certainly thinks you don’t understand. All this can be traced back to the tension or rift that has come between you.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2667">Along with research done by academics on connectivity, I also studied the Scriptures and came upon a paradox. I learned that God intended for some conflict to exist in a marriage (see 1 Corinthians 7:3–4). Even secular research showed that the best marriage relationships have some conflict. It’s almost as if you need a degree of conflict to keep the passion there. The sequence seems to have the couple experience a misunderstanding; they have a minor argument, a bump of some kind. But as they work through this conflict, they deepen their understanding of each other and value and appreciate one another all the more as they reconcile the conflict.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2669"><i>If you are angry with your wife, even for “a brief moment,” she is “grieved in spirit” and “rejected,” and needs reassurance that you love her (Isaiah 54:5–8).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2672">Obviously, when the sparks fly and a couple has a conflict, serious or minor, there is a risk. It can go one of two ways. Sparks can cause a controllable fire that heats the house and makes things warm and comfortable. Or sparks can set a wildfire that burns the house down. All married couples must realize that the sparks are going to be there. The question is, how will you control them?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2674">I talked with one husband who confessed that he tried to motivate his wife to show him some respect by acting very unlovingly. He distanced himself from her. He closed off his spirit in anger. He disregarded her feelings. He argued his points to win and never reconciled. In short, he never made peace with her. He admitted to me, “I thought if I did all that, she’d start showing me a little more respect.” Then he put his head down on the table in despair and said, “But she divorced me. Until now I didn’t know why.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2677">HUSBAND AND WIFE CAN “WORK IT OUT”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2679">As you have conflict, your wife will probably recognize it much sooner than you do. She can feel rejected by you in a way that you do not feel rejected by her (see Isaiah 54:6)<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5397" id="d12e2681">1</a></sup>; consequently, she wants to have things resolved between the two of you, and she will move toward you to get this done. As you go head to head and solve the problem, you become heart to heart. This is very precious to her. It’s a very powerful thing for your wife when she knows that the two of you are at peace.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2685">Don’t refuse to make peace by running from conflict with your spouse. Conflict is not a sign you have a bad marriage. In fact, the Bible says that those who marry “will have trouble” (1 Corinthians 7:28). What kind of trouble did Paul have in mind? Earlier in the chapter, he lays down an excellent principle for dealing with conflict in marriage: “The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does” (1 Corinthians 7:3–4).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2687">In this passage Paul is giving advice to married couples in the church at Corinth. It was not uncommon in the first century for some believers to get the idea that a good Christian would abstain from sex completely, and apparently that was what was going on at Corinth. To correct this error, Paul encourages sexual relations between husband and wife, because this is the way not to fall into temptation and immorality outside of marriage (see v. 5).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2689">It seems a little odd, however, when Paul says that the wife doesn’t have authority over her body and the husband does, and the husband doesn’t have authority over his body and the wife does. What does Paul mean? I believe he is laying out one of the great principles of the New Testament: because you have equal but differing needs, you will experience conflict. But you can work this out as partners. The husband should not act independently from his wife, and the wife should not act independently from her husband. A husband and wife should and can act together.<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5401" id="d12e2691">2</a></sup></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2694"><i>“Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ” (Ephesians 5:21 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2697">It is as if God said, “I’m going to allow for tension to exist in your marriage. I intend for you to work this out, because as you work out your tensions, your relationship is going to deepen and then deepen some more, and you’re going to continue to go through life working it out—back and forth, back and forth.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2699">“MY WIFE IS ALWAYS GETTING HISTORICAL”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2701">As I talked with one man about his marriage, he told me that every time he and his wife got into a fight, she would get “historical.” To be sure I understood, I asked him if he actually meant “hysterical.” He said, “No, historical. She keeps dredging everything up from the past.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2703">Many wives are very good at getting historical. That’s why it doesn’t do a husband a lot of good to try to end a conflict by saying, “Let’s just drop it.” That is not how she thinks, and she will not drop it. She may let it go for the moment, but she will remember, and eventually she will start “rehearsing history” for her husband again.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2705">Almost every husband I have ever talked with can share stories about his wife’s seemingly limitless capacity to remember who said what, where it happened, who was wearing what, etc. Your wife is wired to get historical, to bring things up that you’ve totally forgotten, to go full circle and get them resolved. She’s dredging them up so she can clear the air and feel love in the relationship. And you, the hapless husband who stands bewildered before her seemingly superhuman memory, will have to come to the point where you accept that this is her integrated personality in action and that she can’t “just drop it.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2708">Whenever she gets historical, she is trying to reconcile with you. She wants you to be open with her, and she’s trying to encourage understanding and peace between you. She wants to be sure you aren’t angry with her so that she can feel loved. She is not trying to provoke you, although it may sound that way as she delivers her historical diatribe. Husbands have a hard time believing this. The fellow who told me his wife often got historical was more than skeptical when I tried to explain that she was just trying to increase feelings of love between them.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2710">“No way,” he said in bewilderment. But it’s true because this is how a woman’s mind works. During a conflict, the woman’s approach to solving that conflict is very different from how the man resolves conflict. As discussed in chapter 4, two women who are good friends will get into a serious disagreement, but later—perhaps the next day or perhaps in half an hour—they will resolve it as each one states her side. They get it all out on the table and finally ask each other for forgiveness. The problem is that the typical wife will go home and try to use this same approach to resolving conflict with her husband. But it doesn’t work. Why? Because the typical male resolves conflict without a lot of discussion, sharing of feelings, or apologies.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2712">Some men might apologize to one another, but as a rule it’s just sort of taken for granted that they will “just drop it,” and they do. So when a husband is approached by a wife who wants to resolve a conflict by sharing feelings and coming “full circle” to a resolution, he balks. Halfway around her circle the husband says, “Drop it. Just forget it. It’s over with.” But the problem with that is, she won’t believe him. In her mind, she knows it’s not over. She knows she will bring it up again because she’s still sitting on the whole thing. She is so dominated by the drive to love that it is difficult for her to believe that her husband could process it any other way than she processes it.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2714">Here’s what happens. When you shut down a discussion by saying, “Just drop it,” your wife is likely to think you’re still secretly angry with her and that this thing is really unresolved. Without any resolution, it will be very difficult for her to be happy. This letter catches the frustration a wife can have:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e2716">Inside I continue to die, because I am so unaware of how to let the Lord restore this relationship. My husband has told me on more than one occasion that we are unusual in our love for each other. Most people do not know the intimacy we have at times. But the patterns of arguments . . . and not ever really feeling reconciled are taking a toll on me.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2718">For any husband who wants fewer ongoing arguments, the path to peace is plain. He must learn to simply say, “Honey, I’m sorry. Will you forgive me? I did not mean to do that.” Do this, even if in your mind most of the guilt or blame is hers. The percentage of guilt is not the issue. As always, the real issue is love and respect.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2720">WHY IT’S HARD FOR A MAN TO SAY, “I’M SORRY”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2722">As a husband, I want to share with all husbands that I understand why it’s hard to say, “I’m sorry.” When a woman says, “I’m sorry,” to her it’s an increase of love. But when a man says, “I’m sorry,” he fears that he will lose respect. This is especially true if he says he’s sorry for something and then his wife brings it up again because she isn’t convinced he means it. She simply thinks the issue is not resolved and it must be discussed some more; but he thinks she has just violated his honor code. For him, going over it again is a lot more serious.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2724"><i>“To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit” (1 Peter 3:8).</i></p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e2727"></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2728">It is easy enough, of course, to just accuse the male of being “proud.” I am not saying that there is not some element of pride involved here. But mixed in with male pride is a deep sense of honor and wanting respect. To all husbands I want to say, I’ve been there. I have had to push through and say to Sarah, “I’m sorry. I was wrong.” And when I finally convinced her that I meant it, it healed her spirit. Those simple words put her at peace.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2731">A wife can be extremely upset, but if a husband humbly expresses sorrow for what he did, she melts. I don’t think very many men grasp this. A wife wrote me about a fight she had with her husband earlier in the evening. It was silly. In fact, at one point they had talked about kissing and they ended up fighting. She went to bed, and he came later: “I laid there for a while and then out of the blue he said (facing the wall), ‘I’m sorry, and if you still want that kiss, you can have it.’ And I fell in love with him all over again. Needless to say, we weren’t fighting any more.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2733">As a husband, hear this woman’s language: “I fell in love with him all over again.” A wife has a wide range of emotions—highs and lows. You can energize her toward the high end of the spectrum by doing just what this husband did.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2735">A SHORT COURSE ON PEACEMAKING</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2737">Still not sure about how to make peace with your wife? Following are some good techniques and principles, which correlate with Scripture.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2739">First, have absolute confidence in the power of your loving demeanor<i>.</i> To paraphrase Proverbs 15:1: “A gentle, loving answer turns away wrath, especially your wife’s.” When you show a loving demeanor during a conflict of any kind, you are likely to touch the deepest part of her heart. Your loving attitude triggers something within her heart as a woman. God made her this way. Bottom line, she reciprocates. A husband cannot outgive a good-willed wife. But when you “give in,” be sure you mean it. If she detects insincerity on your part, you’re probably due for another spin on the Crazy Cycle (see page 5).</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2744"><i>“If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men”(Romans 12:18).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2747">Granted, a husband can ask, “What if I keep loving and keep giving in and still feel disrespected? What should I do?” At this point you have earned the right to say, “I am seeking to give in to you and to be loving, but I am feeling disrespected. What am I saying to you that is unloving?” Good-willed women tend to respond to reasonable, loving, honest requests and will seek ways to be more deferential. If your wife did not “see it” the first time, she will very likely see it the second time.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2749">Second, you will make peace with her when you don’t blame her but, instead, confess your part of the blame (see James 5:16). I have said it already, but I repeat for emphasis: admit when you are wrong and apologize by saying, “I’m sorry.” That is a big turn-on for a woman, but an even bigger turn-on is to add, “I think I really understand your feelings and why you react as you do. Will you forgive me?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2751">One more thing about confessing: Your motive should never be to confess so she will admit she was wrong, too, but often that is exactly what happens. Women are wired for “equality.” For example, she doesn’t like feeling inferior or in the wrong, but neither does she want you to feel you’re inferior or in the wrong. After you confess, my prediction is that she will quickly say, “It’s not all your fault. Actually, it’s me too. In fact, it may be more me. I am sorry for what I did. Will you forgive me?” She will meet you halfway almost every time. This is peacemaking in a woman’s world.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2753"><i>“Put yourselves under God’s mighty hand.Then he will honor you at the right time”(1 Peter 5:6 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2756">Some men think, <i>Why bother with all this “I’m sorry” stuff ? They’re just words.</i> You must understand that words are very powerful to your wife. Remember, although she may not be consciously thinking it, you are the Christ figure to her. God has instilled that in her. If you utter sincere words of apology, forgiveness, and love, she will trust those words and trust you. It can heal the whole thing, and you will be joined together, in a sense, as soul mates, “no longer two, but one” (see Matthew 19:6). You will experience the harmony and connectivity that God intended for marriage.<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5408" id="d12e2761">3</a></sup>(Also see appendix A and B.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2766">Peacemaking can be difficult, but it is always worth it. It’s ironic that a lot of men work out in the weight room, trying to make themselves look like Mr. Universe because they think that women get turned on to a hard body the way men are turned on to a female in a bikini. But it doesn’t work that way. What turns her on is personality. Oddly enough, one of the things that really turns her on is saying in genuine humility, “I am sorry. Please forgive me.” This touches her spirit so much that she may want to grab your hand and drag you to the bedroom. Now that seems like a pretty good deal worth any possible loss of respect. I’m not saying it works for every husband, but it has been known to work for many. I had a man come up to me after one of our marriage conference sessions and say, “You know, this saying ‘I’m sorry’ really works. This week I’ve said ‘I’m sorry’ eighty-four times!”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2768">SHE’LL FEEL AT PEACE WITH YOU WHEN . . .</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2770">• you let her vent her frustrations and hurts and don’t get angry and close her off.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2772">• you admit you are wrong and apologize by saying, “I’m sorry. Will you forgive me?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2774">• you understand her natural desire to negotiate, compromise, and defer, and you meet her halfway.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2776">• you try to keep your relationship “up-to-date,” resolving the unresolved and never saying, “Forget it.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2778">• you forgive her for any wrongs she confesses.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2780">• you never nurse bitterness and always reassure her of your love.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2782">• you pray with her after a hurtful time.</p>
