  UNDERSTANDING—DON’T TRY<br />
  TO “FIX” HER; JUST LISTEN</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2469"><span class="dcap" id="d12e2470">W</span>e have already touched on 1 Peter 3:7 in chapters 2 and 3, but now we want to look at this verse through a lens labeled “How to Have Empathy for Your Wife.” Peter advises husbands, “Live with your wives in an understanding way.” I love this verse because Peter doesn’t say that I have to understand Sarah. Like every other male, I know that I cannot totally understand any woman, even the one I love with all my heart. The key is for me to come across as wanting to live with Sarah in an understanding way, and, even more, I want her to know that I trust her heart.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2473">I realize that 1 Peter 3:7 is a controversial verse for some because the complete passage says that husbands should live with their wives in an understanding way “ . . . as unto the weaker vessel” (KJV). Feminists bristle at that one and claim, “The man is not the stronger sex. We’re equal!” What we must remember, however, is that Peter makes a comparative statement, not a qualitative one. He is not saying that women are weak. He is saying that a wife is a “weaker vessel” because of her vulnerability to her husband within the marriage relationship.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2475">Your wife is vulnerable to you in at least two areas: (1) when you say things such as, “I just don’t understand you . . . I wonder if it’s worth it to try?” and (2) when you dishonor her by treating her as less than an equal “fellow heir of the grace of life” (see 1 Peter 3:7). Feminists try to use this verse to say the Bible declares women are the weaker sex. What Peter is saying is that a wife is vulnerable to her husband (not that all women are weaker than all men); and when you, her husband, do not seek to understand her, she is very vulnerable, indeed.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2477">One grateful wife of an understanding husband wrote to tell me, “Even when I have rebelled against his leading, he understands and accepts me, and does not hold a grudge against me.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2479">ALWAYS HANDLE PORCELAIN WITH CARE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2481">One way to look at the phrase “weaker vessel” is to think of two bowls: one made of porcelain; the other made of copper. The husband is copper; the wife is porcelain. It’s not that she is of less value—in fact, a porcelain bowl can sometimes have greater value than a copper bowl. The bowls are different and have different functions in different settings.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2483">But your wife—the porcelain bowl—is delicate. She can be cracked, even broken if you are not careful. In the heat of frustration, a husband might say, “Nobody can understand women—particularly you.” And at this point he might turn around and go off somewhere to stonewall for a while, vowing to himself not to kowtow to her controlling manner until she starts respecting him.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2485">If you’ve been in a situation like this and then uttered unfortunate words along these lines, you might want to look down and notice the holes in your shoes. You just shot yourself in both feet—again. God has not made your wife to function around that kind of attitude. God is calling husbands to realize that their wives are porcelain bowls on which He has placed a clearly legible sign, “Handle with Care.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2487">One husband finally realized his wife was his ally, not his enemy. He saw her as the kind of woman Peter describes, delicate and worthy of honor. In accepting her and appreciating her, the whole relationship began to shift. He said:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e2489">We are on a new plateau of understanding each other. I used to pray over and over, “God, please heal our marriage, the pain is too much. Why did You ever put us together?” Now I am VERY thankful He did! My wife is my match in every way, before I could not see it. A HUGE burden has been lifted . . .</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e2492">I am not the same.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2494">THE C-O-U-P-L-E PRINCIPLES ARE CONNECTED</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2496">Perhaps you have been noticing the connection in the principles that are represented by the letters of the word <i>C-O-U-P-L-E.</i> <b><i>C</i></b>loseness and <b><i>O</i></b>penness are very similar, and one plays off the other. And <b><i>U</i></b>nderstanding plays off of closeness and openness. As you draw close to your wife and are open with her, she will sense that you understand or at least you are trying to. Remember, the husband is the Christ figure; the woman is the church figure. And as a church places its burden on Christ, a wife wants to place her burdens on her husband. Even if she can’t articulate it in these words, your wife thinks of you as that burden bearer—as having those big shoulders. When she comes to you for understanding, it is a compliment. This is a big part of what love is all about. But when you shut her out, close her down, or don’t seem to hear what she is trying to say, it devastates her spirit.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2512"><i>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2515"><i>(Ephesians 5:25).</i></p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2518">TO UNDERSTAND, JUST LISTEN</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2520">How can you be an understanding husband? The most powerful weapons you have are your ears. Just listen to your wife, and she is much more likely to feel understood.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2522">But because his hearing aids are blue, a husband has a major hurdle. To “just listen” is usually not his strong suit. He is better built to analyze, give answers, and “fix” the situation. The unaware husband doesn’t readily decode the messages his wife is sending when she comes to him with her problems. One vivid example is when Sarah and I were first dating at Wheaton College. She was taking Spanish and wasn’t doing very well. As we sat in the library one day, she started telling me her troubles with her Spanish class. I listened carefully as she poured out her problems, then I said, “Okay, I’ll start working on this. The solution is in creating a study calendar. We break your lessons up into little pieces, and each day you study a small chunk.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2524">Then and there at the library study table, I busied myself laying out a study schedule for Sarah. In a few minutes I had the schedule complete. I looked up, and Sarah was nowhere to be found. I glanced across the library and saw her laughing heartily with her girlfriends, having a good time. Unsure of what was going on, I wondered to myself, <i>Did I somehow solve her problem already?</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2528">So I caught Sarah’s eye and motioned her over. She came quickly and sat down with a happy look on her face. “Did I solve your Spanish problem?” I asked.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2530">“Oh, no, not really.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2533">“Then why are you happy?” I asked.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2535">“I just needed somebody to listen to me,” Sarah said with a big smile. “Now I feel better.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2537">Somehow I had managed to give Sarah just what she wanted—an understanding ear. Of course, I went on to try to “fix her problem,” but by the time I had started on that she already felt better. You might say I lucked out on that one. Later there were other situations after we were engaged and then married where I was guilty of wanting to fix more than listen, and I heard about it.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2539">The dynamic that was at work that day in the library when I listened to Sarah pour out her Spanish problems is a very powerful one. The truth is, I really didn’t have to fix her problem; all she really wanted was my listening ear. (I learned that Sarah has needs that I do not have, and that is okay. Also, she has learned that I have needs she does not have, and that is okay with her!) As a husband, if you can grasp that you don’t always have to solve your wife’s problems, you will take a giant step toward showing her empathy and understanding. Not only that, but it will save a lot of time, trouble, and turns on the Crazy Cycle.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2541">“DO YOU NEED A SOLUTION . . . OR MY EAR? ”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2543">Over the years I have had my ups and downs with being a good listener, but I have learned when Sarah comes to me with a burden, I ask two questions. The first question is, “Am I in trouble?” The answer to this is usually, “No, no, no.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2545">My second question is really the more important one. “Do you need a solution or a listening ear?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2547">Then Sarah can say, and she usually does, “I just need you to listen.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2549">So I listen. After Sarah has shared her problem, big or small, she feels better. She goes away feeling understood and loved. The Energizing Cycle is humming.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2551">But in counseling situations and at our conferences, I meet many husbands who don’t “get it.” In fact, trying to fix instead of listen is often a big point of conflict in the marriage. These husbands are still operating with strictly blue sunglasses and blue hearing aids. They are coming at problems like men.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2553">At times one man comes to another with his problem. Instinctively, Harry knows that Joe is not approaching him so he can “release his emotions.” He knows Joe isn’t hoping that he will just “listen to him.” (Only when a man is in a really major crisis will he want someone to just listen because he is absolutely at the end of his tether.) But 95 to 98 percent of the time one man comes to another to share his problem because he would like some help. So Harry says, “Well, have you tried this?” and he lays out a possible solution.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2556">“That’s a good idea,” says Joe. “Thanks a lot.”</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2558"><i>The wise husband is “quick to listen, slow to speak”(James 1:19 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2561">Men, you see, believe they help others by solving their problems. It is well known that men and women score differently on tests. He is high in analytical aptitude; she is high on verbal aptitude. He tends to think in terms of analysis, and that is the way he processes things. (More on this in chapter 19, covering the husband’s <b><i>I</i></b>nsight.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2567">And so, after helping Joe out, Harry might go home, where his wife approaches him with a problem. Because he had such good luck with Joe, Harry tries to solve her problem, only to hear, “Will you quit trying to fix me and just try to listen?” Being a typical male, Harry doesn’t like this response much. He can’t believe his wife can be so disrespectful and ungrateful. After all, he was only trying to help. But it’s at this point that Harry needs to pull back. He needs to learn the line: “Honey, do you need a solution or do you just want me to listen?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2569">This isn’t natural, but I guarantee it is effective. One thing to remember is that when a wife comes to a husband with her problem, she isn’t coming because she wants him to solve it. In fact, in many cases she knows exactly what she needs to do. But she’s coming to share, to feel understood, to communicate at an entirely different level. Men tend to communicate for one reason only: to exchange information. They wonder, “Why else would you want to communicate? Get to the facts. Share opinions. Come to some conclusions. What else is there?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2571">So when a wife comes up and says, “Can we talk?” the husband responds, “What about?” He is ready to exchange information, to give solutions. But then she says, “Oh, I don’t know. I just need to talk.” This is not a comforting line for the average husband. This throws his information exchange system totally out of whack. He begins to get suspicious. She must be setting him up to bawl him out about something.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2573"><i>Hannah is barren, so her husband tries analytically to solve her problem: “Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” (1 Samuel 1:8).</i></p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2576">“JUST TALKING” IS A KEY TO UNDERSTANDING</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2578">In chapters 9 and 10 I stressed the importance of setting aside time to talk to your wife. This is not an option. This is a must. Talking is when women report to build rapport. This may sound like “small talk” to you. You may or may not be ready for it at all times, particularly after getting home from a hard day at work, but take time to talk to her if at all possible. Understand the importance she puts on sharing her report and having you share yours. You don’t have to give every detail of the day. Try, however, to go over a few highlights, a certain happening, something that will make her feel loved because she will be building rapport with the most important person in her life.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2580">Remember, too, that wives love to talk to release their emotions. Because a woman is an integrated personality, she is like a teakettle—she collects all the things that have happened to her over the day, and there is a buildup. She needs to release some of these feelings, and it really can’t wait until tomorrow or the next day. As we discussed in chapter 10, men are compartmentalized. You can stuff things away and not have to talk about them; you don’t have pressure building inside the way your wife does. When you let her share her small talk and give her a chance to “let off steam,” she will feel good. She will feel connected to you.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2582"></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2584"><i>“Since she is a woman”(1 Peter 3:7), God made your wife with different needs and vulnerabilities from your own; so don’t pass judgment on her.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2587">Women also need to talk to realize their feelings. Men usually know what they are feeling, and they will talk about it if they think it is necessary. Women, on the other hand, can be feeling a lot of things but not know exactly what they are. As they begin to talk about what happened through the day, they can work back to the problem that they can’t seem to put their finger on. That’s why a wife sometimes says, “Can we talk?” When asked, “Why?” she doesn’t really know—she just had a bad day and, “I just need to talk.” As a husband, you must realize your wife needs to process her feelings—to realize exactly how she is feeling. As she talks to you, it clarifies things for her; then she feels better and she feels understood.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2589">UNDERSTANDING TAKES SCHEDULED TIME</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2591">Sarah and I came to a point in our marriage where our kids were young and the demands of the day were heavy on both of us. So, after dinner, we told our oldest son to watch the other two, and we locked ourselves in our bedroom. This fifteen-minute period was Mom and Dad’s time, and the rule was “Don’t interrupt until we’re done.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2593">The best thing about those fifteen minutes after dinner was that they were predictable. Sarah knew this would be her time to talk to me, to share her feelings. At another stage in our marriage, we were having some tension because Sarah was always seeing me either coming or going. She wanted more than transitional moments to tell me all the things that she was feeling, so we set up a date night. The tension disappeared because now Sarah had a predictable time with me: Thursday nights. And so she’d save up what she had on her mind and heart. She would literally make lists, and after we had dinner somewhere, she would go down her list and we would talk.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2595">Some husbands might be wondering, “Okay, you and Sarah talk—about <i>what</i>?” If your wife is typical, you don’t have to carry the conversation; just be sure to listen. Don’t be thinking of tomorrow’s appointment or getting the car serviced, etc. And every now and then repeat back what she is saying. For example, “That’s interesting. What I hear you saying is . . .” This way she will know you are listening and that you care about what she is saying.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2600">There are many ways to let your wife know that you are trying to understand her and what she faces each day as the emotional center of your home. At every opportunity express appreciation for all she does. We know of one husband who gave his wife a special card, thanking her for every menial task she does around their home: from washing the clothes to doing the cooking, from taking the kids to school with lunches packed to helping them with their homework. There was a list of ten or fifteen items. The wife was so touched by this card that she said, “I’m sticking this in my Bible and I’m going to reread it often.”</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2602"><i>As an understanding husband, always be “making the most of your time” (Ephesians 5:16).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2605">That wife felt understood—at least in part. Be aware, however, that a woman’s need to feel you understand is insatiable. It will take constant effort on your part, and while you can never do it perfectly, every effort you make will tell her, “I love you.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2607">This husband’s letter sums it up beautifully: It has always been one of my goals to provide my wife with a safe environment in which she can be free to be the person God made her to be, and I hope that this is happening. She now freely identifies herself as someone who, just a couple of years ago, was “not happy,” but has put that behind her. I hope that I am understanding her better and being a better friend to her. We have a lot of challenges each week raising four kids, but we are a team, and I feel like we are working through all of it together, with God’s active presence and help.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2609">SHE’LL FEEL YOU’RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HER WHEN . . .</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2612">• you listen and can repeat back what she said.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2614">• you don’t try to “fix her problems” unless she specifically asks for a solution.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2616">• you try to identify her feelings.</p>
