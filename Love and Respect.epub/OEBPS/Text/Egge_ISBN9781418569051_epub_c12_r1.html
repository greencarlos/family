  <br />
  TO COMMUNICATE,<br />
  DECIPHER THE CODE</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e652"><span class="dcap" id="d12e653">I</span>f husbands and wives are to understand the Love and Respect Connection, they must realize that they communicate in code. And the problem is, they don’t know how to decipher the messages they send to one another.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e656">A couple was about to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary, and the wife began to wonder if her husband would remember. There had been plenty of times during the past decade when he had forgotten their anniversary altogether. No matter what she did—little hints, bigger hints—he would miss it. But on their tenth wedding anniversary, with no hints at all, he remembers! He makes a beeline for Hallmark and is soon gazing upon all those racks full of greeting cards. One colorful card quickly catches his eye. He skims the words—they are perfect! He thinks, <i>This card is</i> her<i>—no doubt about it</i>. He grabs it off the shelf, pays the clerk, and hurries home rejoicing. Finally, he has remembered their anniversary, and a special one it will be too.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e664">She is there when he arrives at home, so he sneaks the card into another room, signs it, and quickly writes her name on the envelope. He even adds a couple of tiny hearts over her name as an extra touch. Then he comes out and hands his wife her tenth anniversary card. She beams from ear to ear. She is so happy—finally he has remembered! She tears open the card and begins to read . . . and then her face falls. The eyes that had been bright with loving energy turn cold. Her beaming countenance becomes sour and dark.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e666">“What’s wrong?” her husband asks. (He’s a very sensitive guy, and he can pick up on these things.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e668">“Nothing.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e670">“There is, too. What’s wrong?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e672">“No, there’s <i>nothing</i> wrong.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e677">“But there is—I can see it. What is it?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e679">“Well, it’s not bad . . . for a <i>birthday</i> card.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e684">As you might guess, the conversation is headed downhill from here. “You’re kidding!” says the husband, grabbing the card from her hand. “No way . . . unbelievable!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e687">“No, <i>you’re</i> unbelievable!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e692">The husband blinks in the face of his wife’s very real anger. He knows he is full of goodwill. He has remembered their tenth anniversary. He has bought her a present as well as a card. “Well, honey, I made an honest mistake. Give me a break.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e694">“Give you a break? An honest mistake—oh, it was an honest mistake, all right, because you just don’t care. Do you know what? If you took your car in to be detailed and they put a stripe on the side that was even a fraction of an inch off, you would notice that, right? Why? Because you <i>care</i> about it. But you don’t care about our anniversary. You don’t care about <i>me</i>!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e702">The husband can’t believe it. He is moving from feeling guilty to getting angry. What he thought would be a loving celebration of their tenth anniversary has become a conflict that is escalating fast.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e704">“Hey, I made an honest mistake, all right? Give me a break. Good grief !”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e706">“You buy me a birthday card on our tenth anniversary, and you expect me not to be upset? I’d rather you hadn’t bought me any card at all!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e708">The husband has been on the defensive, but now his pulse rate is up. He has tried to do the loving thing, and all his wife can do is say nasty things.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e710">“You know what? The way you’re talking I’m <i>glad</i> I got you a birthday card for your anniversary!” And with that brilliant parting shot, he storms out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Approximately two minutes have passed since he handed her the card. This couple, a husband and wife who truly love each other, have come home expecting to spend a wonderful, romantic evening together. Instead, they end up stomping to opposite ends of the house, staring out the windows into the darkness, wondering how it had ever come to this, and thinking, <i>This is crazy!</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e717"><i>When counseling couples, I often ask, “What causes fights and quarrels among you?”(James 4:1 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e720">This story is based on an actual incident, and I have collected many others like it from couples Sarah and I have counseled. Angry exchanges are caused when the husband appears careless, depriving his wife of love, and when the wife reacts with criticism and complaints that are vehement, depriving the husband of respect. And why should she be respectful? The stupid oaf doesn’t deserve her respect!</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e722">“ALL YOU WANT ME FOR IS SEX!”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e725">Here’s one more example. The husband is gone for a week on a business trip. As his plane lands, he starts envisioning a romantic sexual evening with his wife, so he hurries home as quickly as he can. As he walks in the door, his wife’s first words are, “What are you doing home so early? Well, since you’re here, I need you to pick up the kids from school. And don’t forget, we have parent-teacher meetings this evening. Oh, yes . . . I want to talk to you about Billy. The teacher called today and said he’s been showing off and distracting his friends in class. And on the way to the school, can you pick up my clothes at the cleaners? Oh, I almost forgot. Dinner will be late because my sister is dropping over for coffee.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e727">So much for the romantic evening planned by our knight of the business road who has wound up playing second fiddle to the kids, the cleaning, and his wife’s sister. On his way out the back door he calls sarcastically over his shoulder, “Great to see you after a week!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e729">His wife is bothered by his sarcastic tone, but just as he walks out the phone rings and she doesn’t have time to follow him outside to ask him what he meant. Later, during the parent-teacher meetings, she senses he is still angry, but on the way home she says nothing. She is exhausted from all the week’s activities, and she is upset because he has never asked her once about all she has had to deal with. She wonders what right he has to be upset with her when <i>he</i> is the one being unreasonable.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e734">As they retire into bed that night, the husband decides that he will “make up” with his wife in the most obvious and natural way. As he reaches to rub her back, which is usually a good way to get started, she groans, “Don’t. I’m too tired.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e736">Angrily, he rolls away from her without saying a word. Wounded by his anger, she says, “You’re so insensitive!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e738">In disbelief, he replies, “I can’t believe you said that. I’ve been gone for a week. I come home and instead of any kind of greeting, you just go on about the kids and your sister. When I try to get close, you tell me you’re too tired. And then <i>you</i> call <i>me</i> insensitive! Am I just a meal ticket to you?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e746">By now the wife is very hurt, and she retorts, “You never asked once how I was doing. The only time you get interested in me it’s for sex!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e748">“I was gone a week! When we were first married and I had to travel, you couldn’t wait to see me get home. You’d greet me at the door with a smile and a kiss. Now you simply look up and say, ‘Why are you home so early?’ Thanks. That makes my day.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e750">CRAZINESS—JUST KEEP FLIPPING THE LIGHT SWITCH</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e752">Stories like these are not unusual. Every married couple has versions of their own. Around and around it spins. I call it the Crazy Cycle. So many people are on the Crazy Cycle that five out of ten couples in the church are divorcing, and the craziness seems to be getting worse. It’s like someone coming into a room, flipping the light switch, and discovering the lights won’t come on. If someone tries the switch two or three times with no results, you can understand. He will eventually figure it out—a tripped circuit breaker, a burned-out bulb. But if he stands there and flips the switch constantly for half an hour, you begin to wonder, “Is this guy a little crazy?”</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e754"><i>Runaway divorce statistics reveal that “insanity is in their hearts”(Ecclesiastes 9:3).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e758">The point is simple: <i>Craziness happens when we keep doing the same things over and over with the same ill effect</i>. Marriage seems to be fertile ground for this kind of craziness. Ironically, there are more books being published on marriage today than ever before. There are books on marital communication, money management, sex, etc. There are even books on how to become a better husband (or wife) in thirty days! But with all our knowledge, the craziness continues. And it doesn’t seem to matter if the couples are Christians or unbelievers. Why? I have concluded that those of us in the church, who believe we have the Truth, are not using the whole truth. A crucial part of God’s Word has been completely ignored or perhaps simply gone unnoticed when it has been there all the time right under our noses!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e763">Many Christian spouses know Ephesians 5:33 and can at least paraphrase it. The apostle Paul tells husbands to love their wives as much as they love themselves, and wives are to respect their husbands. But is anyone really listening? Perhaps the first step to better communication between husband and wife is to hear what God’s Word clearly says.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e765">WHY DO COUPLES COMMUNICATE IN CODE?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e767">Communication in marriage has been described, discussed, and dissected in hundreds, if not thousands, of books and articles. Why is communication between husbands and wives such a problem? It goes back to the fact that we send each other messages in “code,” based on gender, even though we don’t intend to. What I say is not what you hear, and what you think you heard is not what I meant at all.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e769">Let’s see how this plays out at home as a couple is getting dressed to start the day.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e771">She says, “I have nothing to wear.” (She means, she has nothing <i>new</i>.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e776">He says, “I have nothing to wear.” (He means, he has nothing <i>clean</i>.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e781">There is no serious danger of conflict here, but the “nothing to wear” line illustrates that we all see things out of our own needs and perceptions. Just the other day, I was working on my computer and Sarah had the radio on in the next room. It was some kind of talk show and just loud enough to derail my train of thought. I yelled to her, “Are you listening to that?” There was no reply. I yelled again, “Are you <i>listening</i> to that?” Still no answer. Finally, I yelled louder, “Are you listening to the radio?!” She yelled back, “I have been trying to listen, but you keep interrupting!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e786">This created a two-minute exchange that almost turned into a serious argument. It seems Sarah was irritated with me because she hadn’t even noticed the radio—she was busy with something else. But she thought I had called to her because there was something on this talk show that I really wanted her to hear. Of course, my real intention was that she turn off the radio if she wasn’t really listening to it. So I was irritated with her because she hadn’t understood me.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e788">Finally, it came to me that I hadn’t been very clear about what I had meant, and yelling at her three times wasn’t too loving either. So I apologized. I cite this little misunderstanding to point out that things like this can escalate, particularly if husband and wife are a bit upset with one another about something that happened the day before (or possibly just a few minutes ago). In other cases, couples may be experiencing long-term tension, which can escalate when fed by a simple miscommunication.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e790">At a certain point, the issue isn’t about turning off the radio, or whatever the miscommunication may be. The wife can get irked with the husband because he isn’t being sensitive, something that most wives always anticipate or expect. In less than a minute, the wife can start feeling unloved and accuse her husband of being unloving. Meanwhile, the husband can get displeased with the wife when she starts talking to him as if he’s insensitive. He starts reciting the mantra of many husbands: “I can never be good enough.” The husband is feeling disrespected or at least unfairly criticized—again. A tiny spark in a dry forest can quickly catch fire, and if a couple doesn’t know how to put it out, it can grow into a serious conflagration.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e793">“WHEN THE ISSUE ISN’T THE ISSUE”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e795">In almost every case, the issue that seems to be the cause of the craziness is not the real issue at all. Do you ever get into a conflict with your spouse but you aren’t sure why? You see your spouse deflate or bristle or go cold, and then you think, <i>What is wrong here? What’s happening?</i> Typically, you write it off by saying, “If only she weren’t so touchy” or, “If only he weren’t so childish.” Of course, if <i>you</i> are the one who is offended, that’s different. Your spouse is guilty of stepping on your toes—again.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e803">Just because you may feel unloved or disrespected does not mean your spouse is sending that message. When the wife felt unloved because she got a birthday card for her tenth anniversary, it did not mean that the husband was sending her a message saying, “I really don’t care about you or love you.” At the same time, when his wife reacted in an angry and disrespectful way, that did not mean her message was, “I don’t respect you any farther than I can throw you.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e805">When the traveling businessman came home expecting to be sexually intimate and his wife was unresponsive, the message she was sending was not, “I don’t respect you or your needs.” And the husband may have become moody or upset, but he was not signaling that he did not love her. Often, we focus on our own needs and simply overlook the needs of the other person. The wife needs love; she is not trying to be disrespectful. The husband needs respect; he is not trying to be unloving. Once you grasp this basic principle—that the “issue” is not the real issue at all—you are on your way to cracking the communication code.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e807">WE’RE AS DIFFERENT AS PINK AND BLUE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e809">When the issue isn’t the real issue, it is crucial to understand that one thing is going on in the spirit of the wife and an entirely different thing is going on in the spirit of the husband. The opening chapters of Genesis tell us God created them male and female. That’s hardly news. But what it underlines is that men and women are <i>very</i> different. For example, Peter notes that difference when he instructs husbands to treat wives in a very specific way “<i>since</i> she is a woman” (1 Peter 3:7; italics mine).</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e817"><i>Matthew 19:4 tells us “the Creator ‘made them male and female’ ”(NIRV); in other words, very different.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e820">The way I like to picture the difference between men and women is that the woman looks at the world through pink sunglasses that color all she sees. The man, however, looks at the world through blue sunglasses that color all he sees. Men and women can look at precisely the same situation and see life much differently. Inevitably, their pink and blue lenses cause their interpretation of things to be at odds to some degree.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e822">Not only do men and women see differently, but they also hear differently. To carry the pink and blue analogy a little further, God created men with blue hearing aids and women with pink hearing aids. They may hear the same words but get much different messages (as in, “I have nothing to wear!”). Because men and women have sunglasses and hearing aids in different colors, they send each other messages in different codes.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e824">When the spirit of your wife deflates before your eyes, and you suddenly sense an issue, she’s sending a code. Of course, if there were a thousand women watching and listening, wearing their pink sunglasses and pink hearing aids, they would quickly say, “Well, I know why that sweet little thing is shutting down on him. She’s so sweet and tender. I can’t believe it; look at how he’s talking to her.” To women, the code is obvious as they decipher the message through pink sunglasses and pink hearing aids. No wonder they often think, <i>Men are so brain dead. They have two brains—one’s lost and the other is out looking for it!</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e828">But turn it around. When the wife sees the spirit of her husband deflate, or he gets angry and won’t talk, his behavior seems childish to her. But if a thousand men with blue sunglasses and blue hearing aids were watching and listening, they would say, “I know why that guy shut down on her. Good grief ! Look at the way she’s talking to him. Unbelievable! Get that witch a broom!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e831">Are you beginning to see why male/female communication can be such a problem? Let’s go back to the story of the anniversary card that turned into “Happy Birthday.” When the wife sees that her husband has purchased a birthday card, her spirit deflates in an instant. He has forgotten their anniversary many times, but this is the last straw! Obviously, her husband doesn’t even love her enough to take the time to <i>read</i> a card he bought for her!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e836">So she sends him an angry message, and, of course, it was in code. Does he decode her words and expressions correctly? Of course not. He is wearing blue sunglasses. All he sees is anger, irritation, and disrespect. He feels guilty, then irritated. After all, he made an honest mistake . . . give him a break!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e838">But the wife peers through her pink sunglasses, and she will have none of this “honest mistake” bit. She takes the conflict to a new low by assassinating his character. He thinks more of his car than he thinks of her!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e840">That does it. He is glad he bought her a birthday card—it serves her right. He doesn’t have to deal with this. And he walks out. So they both spend their tenth anniversary wondering how a little thing like a card could cause so much craziness. But, of course, the card wasn’t really the issue. The real issue was that the wife felt unloved and responded the only way she knew how—by getting in her husband’s face and telling him off. (Not all wives do that, but most lean in that direction at such moments!) With her pink sunglasses and pink hearing aids firmly in place, she wanted him to be genuinely sorry —not defensive, but asking forgiveness. Then they could have gone out for a nice dinner. But his blue sunglasses and blue hearing aids wouldn’t let that happen. His real issue—which he probably couldn’t even verbalize—is that he felt disrespected. He would show her, and so two essentially good-willed people wound up spinning on the Crazy Cycle with no clue about how to slow it down or stop it.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e842"><i>The good-willed husband is “concerned about . . . how he may please his wife” and the good-willed wife is “concerned about . . . how she may please her husband”(1 Corinthians 7:33–34).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e845">What do I mean by “good-willed people”? Simply that both of these people love each other a great deal. They do not mean real harm; they do not intend real evil toward one another. They are hurt and angry, but they still care deeply for one another. That is why they spent their anniversary evening in separate rooms, miserable, wondering how this whole stupid thing could have happened. (And the reason neither will figure it out is that each blames the other for the whole sorry affair.)</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e847">SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CONFIRMS THE CENTRALITY OF LOVE AND RESPECT</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e849">As long as spouses do not learn to decode the pink and blue messages they are sending one another, the Crazy Cycle will spin and spin some more. What is that one thing that is going on inside of her, where the code is obviously pink? What is the one thing that is going on inside of him, where the code is obviously blue? The woman absolutely needs love, and the man absolutely needs respect. It’s as simple—and as difficult—as that.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e851">Interestingly enough, scientific research confirms that love and respect are the foundation of a successful marriage. Dr. John Gottman, professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington, led a research team that spent twenty years studying two thousand couples who had been married twenty to forty years to the same partner. These people came from diverse backgrounds and had widely differing occupations and lifestyles. But one thing was similar—the tone of their conversations. As these couples talked together, almost always there was what Gottman calls “a strong undercurrent of two basic ingredients: Love and Respect. These are the direct opposite of—and antidote for—contempt, perhaps the most corrosive force in marriage.”<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5281" id="d12e853">1</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e856">Gottman’s findings confirm what has already been in Scripture for some two thousand years. Chapter 5 of Ephesians is considered by many to be the most significant treatise on marriage in the New Testament. Paul concludes these statements on marriage by getting gender specific in verse 33. He reveals commands from the very heart of God as he tells the husband he <i>must</i> love (<i>agape</i>) his wife unconditionally and the wife <i>must</i> respect her husband, whether or not her husband comes across as loving.<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5288" id="d12e867">2</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e870">Note, however, that this verse gives no command to a wife to <i>agape-</i>love her husband. As I studied this verse over the years, I began to ask, “Why is there no command for a wife to <i>agape</i> her husband?” And then it struck me. The Lord has created a woman to love. Her whole approach to nurture, her sensitivity, love, and compassion are all part of her very nature. In short, God designed the woman to love. He’s not going to command her to <i>agape</i> her husband when He created her to do that in the first place. God is not into redundancy.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e882">Let’s go a little further with this and skip over to Titus 2:4. Here, older women are told to encourage younger women to love their husbands and children, but in this case, Paul is not talking about <i>agape</i> love. In Titus 2:4, he uses the Greek word <i>phileo,</i> which refers to the human, brotherly kind of love. The point is, a young wife is created to <i>agape</i> her husband and children. Ultimately, she will never stop unconditionally loving them. But in the daily wear and tear of life, she is in danger of becoming discouraged—so discouraged that she may lack <i>phileo.</i> A kind of impatient unfriendliness can come over her. She may scold and sigh way too much. After all, there is always something or someone who needs correcting. She cares deeply. Her motives are filled with <i>agape,</i> but her methods lack <i>phileo</i>.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e903">Not every woman has this problem, but I have counseled many who admit they do have their periods of negativity concerning husbands or the children. Sometimes this is known as PMS (Pre-Murder Syndrome). Everyone ducks for cover when Mom is in that kind of mood. No one doubts her basic mother love, but sometimes they’re not so sure she really <i>likes</i> them.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e908">Part of the problem, however, is that women are not at all sure <i>they</i> are being loved, especially by their husbands. The question continues to come up: “Does he love me as much as I love him?” It sure doesn’t seem like it. When he acts (or reacts) in ways that seem unloving to her, she reacts in ways that feel disrespectful to him. Who started it? Yes!</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e913">“YOU’RE STEPPING ON MY AIR HOSE!”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e915">The more I meditated on these two passages of Scripture, the more I realized that if a husband is commanded to <i>agape</i>-love his wife, then she truly <i>needs</i> love. In fact, she needs love just as she needs air to breathe. Picture, if you would, the wife having an air hose that goes to a love tank. When her husband bounds in and starts prancing around like a ten-point buck looking for someplace to graze, he steps on her air hose. This does not make her a happy camper. In fact, if she can find a baseball bat or some other weapon, she might just whack the big buck and tell him, “Get off my air hose; I can’t breathe.” Simply put, when her deepest need is being stepped on, you can expect her to react negatively.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e923">In counseling, I tell the husband that when he sees the spirit of his wife deflate, he is stepping on her air hose. She is not getting the “air” she needs to breathe. She is crying out, “I feel unloved by you right now. I can’t believe how unloving this feels. I can’t believe you’re doing this to me.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e925">Not only is the husband commanded to love his wife, but the wife is commanded to respect her husband. You see, the husband needs respect just as he needs air to breathe. He also has an air hose that runs over to a big tank labeled “respect,” and as long as the “air” is coming through, he is just fine.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e927">To keep the deer analogy going, suppose the wife, a lovely doe, starts tromping on his air hose with her sharp little hoofs. As we have seen ina story like the tenth anniversary birthday card, the wife may have had good reason to prance all over her husband’s air hose, but what’s going to happen? As his air hose starts to leak because of all the little cuts her hoofs have made in it, the husband is also going to react because his deepest need (respect) is not being met. And the battle is on.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e929">As I worked out what Ephesians 5:33 is saying, I started doodling with a diagram like the face of a clock. At 12:00 I wrote, “Without love.” At 3:00 I wrote, “She reacts.” (If she needs love like she needs air to breathe, and she’s being suffocated, she <i>will</i> react.) Then at 6:00 I wrote, “Without respect,” and at 9:00, “He reacts.” (If he needs unconditional respect like he needs air to breathe, and he’s hearing criticism or being attacked in some way, he <i>will</i> react.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e937">And there you have it—the Crazy Cycle (see page 5). Husbands and wives keep spinning on the Crazy Cycle because they don’t understand that what seems to be the issue isn’t the issue at all. The real issues are always love and respect. Everything else is just filling in the details.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e939">MEN HEAR CRITICISM AS CONTEMPT; WOMEN FEEL SILENCE AS HOSTILITY</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e942">Let me emphasize to wives that when men hear negative criticism, it doesn’t take them long to start interpreting that as contempt for who they are as men. Remember, the man is wearing blue hearing aids. When his wife sends out those pink but very pointed messages and his air hose starts to leak, he soon says to himself, <i>I don’t deserve this kind of talk. Everybody respects me except you. You’re just picking a fight. I wish you would just be quiet.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e946">When a husband can take it no longer, he gets up and walks out without a word, and that is the <i>coup de grâce.</i> He might as well have screamed at the top of his lungs, “I don’t love you!” The wife is dazed. First, she has been treated unlovingly. Second, she has tried to move toward her husband by doing the loving thing. And now he has shown her he is the most hostile, unloving human being on the planet by just walking away and leaving her there! That does it! She is not far from thinking she has all kinds of grounds for divorce. (But if she does stop to think, she will realize that she started the whole thing with her criticism.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e951">Often both spouses have goodwill but are not deciphering each other’s code. She criticizes out of love, but he “hears” only disrespect. He distances himself to prevent things from escalating, which is the honorable thing to do, but she “sees” only his failure to be loving!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e953">Right about now the women reading this are saying, “Well, if husbands just weren’t so immature . . . if my husband could just be man enough to talk things out, then we could get somewhere.” You can think that kind of thing, and I understand why you would. Unfortunately, it’s not going to change men at all. This attitude of men goes a lot deeper than the fact that they might be immature or proud. Men have an honor code. When a wife comes at a husband who has basic goodwill, he doesn’t want to fight verbally or physically. As his wife rails at him or criticizes, he sits there quietly, which makes her angrier than ever. Because her frontal attack isn’t working, she soon sees him as cold and uncaring. Meanwhile, he’s thinking, <i>I can’t believe this. My wife is treating me with disrespect—in fact, it’s really contempt. All she can say is that I am unloving.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e957">The Crazy Cycle continues to spin. As she gets louder, he gets quieter. Soon she may be screaming at him with venomous words that he’s never heard in all his life. As a rule, women have learned to fight with words. They are masters of the art, and husbands can feel helpless before the onslaught.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e959">I want to underline that this happens all the time with couples who actually have good intentions—and maybe more so because they feel freer to let down their guard and express what upsets them. Most husbands and wives who are on the Crazy Cycle have basic goodwill toward one another, but they just don’t know how to express it. And so the Crazy Cycle eventually spins many of them right into separation and divorce. I’ve had couples fighting with one another in my office, and I have said, “Time out . . . time out! Sir, let me ask you something, does your wife have basic goodwill toward you and others? Would you entrust the children to her?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e961">“Oh, absolutely.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e963">“Ma’am, does he have basic goodwill toward you and others, and would you entrust the children to him?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e965">“Of course.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e967">“Then what is going on with you two? How can two good-willed people treat one another this way?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e969">The husband and the wife will look at me as if to ask, “Why don’t you tell us? All we know is, we fight and fight and fight, and usually we really don’t know why.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e972">As I have tried to explain to many couples over the years, a major part of the answer is learning how to decode each other’s messages. Whenever a wife is complaining, criticizing, or crying, she is sending her encoded message: “I want your love!” And whenever a husband is speaking harshly or sometimes not speaking at all, he is sending his encoded message: “I want your respect.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e974">We’ve begun to see how this decoding can start to happen, but there are still problems that stand in the way. Men, for the most part, are masters at stonewalling their wives, who confront them because they feel unloved. And many women are so fed up with husbands who don’t seem to want to love them that the last thing they want to grant is respect. These women say the husband has to earn her respect before she will grant it; but, of course, if she continues to disrespectfully hammer at him, especially when he is trying to do the honorable thing, nothing much will happen. We’ll look at how all this plays out and how husbands and wives can deal with these problems in the next chapter.</p>
