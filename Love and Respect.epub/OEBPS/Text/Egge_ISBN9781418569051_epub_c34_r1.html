  THE ENERGIZING CYCLE WILL<br />
  WORK IF YOU DO</a></p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4270">I sent him an e-mail one day, letting him know why I respect him. He told me that night he was very touched. . . . I really just prayed and let God lead me in what to say to him and it worked. Also, for some time we have sent SHMILY (<b><i>S</i></b>ee <b><i>H</i></b>ow <b><i>M</i></b>uch <b><i>I L</i></b>ove <b><i>Y</i></b>ou) messages to each other. I changed mine to SHMIRY (<b><i>S</i></b>ee <b><i>H</i></b>ow <b><i>M</i></b>uch <b><i>I R</i></b>espect <b><i>Y</i></b>ou) and he loved that. The following week, my husband called me in the middle of the day to tell me the reasons he loves me. We’ve been married almost ten years and he’s never done that!</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4313"><span class="dcap" id="d12e4314">T</span>his wife’s letter is one of dozens that I could use to sum up the power that can be at work in a marriage when the Energizing Cycle is in high gear. Understanding that a wife’s deepest need is for love and a husband’s deepest need is for respect is the core in how to make your marriage better. In Energizing Cycle terms, his love motivates her respect; her respect motivates his love. (See page 115.)</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4317">HOW DOES A HUSBAND SPELL LOVE TO HIS WIFE?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4319">As we have seen, love to wives is spelled C-O-U-P-L-E. Following is a brief review of these six concepts. If a husband memorizes and uses even one or two of them each day, he will do his part in keeping the Energizing Cycle going. Husbands should ask themselves these questions:</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4321">1. <b><i>C</i></b>loseness—Am I always remembering to move toward her and accept her need to talk and connect with me to be reassured of my love?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4327">2. <b><i>O</i></b>penness—Do I share my thoughts with her, and am I sure I’m not resisting her efforts to draw me out?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4333">3. <b><i>U</i></b>nderstanding—Am I careful not to try to “fix” her every time she talks about one of her concerns or problems? Am I remembering that she is an integrated personality and whatever happens affects all of her, especially her emotions?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4339">4. <b><i>P</i></b>eacemaking—Am I always willing to resolve issues, and am I careful to never say, “Let’s just drop it and move on”?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4345">5. <b><i>L</i></b>oyalty—Do I constantly look for ways to tell her that I will be loyal to her forever—that she’s the one love of my life, the only woman for me?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4351">6. <b><i>E</i></b>steem—Do I always let her know that I treasure her and put highest value on her as a person? Do I let her know that what she does and thinks are important to me? Does she know I couldn’t possibly do without her?</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4358">HOW DOES A WIFE SPELL RESPECT FOR HER HUSBAND?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4360">A wife spells respect for her husband C-H-A-I-R-S and uses these six concepts to let him know how important and vital he is to her. Wives should ask themselves these questions:</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4362">1. <b><i>C</i></b>onquest—Am I always standing behind him and letting him know I support him in his work and endeavors in his field?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4368">2. <b><i>H</i></b>ierarchy—Do I let him know I respect and appreciate his desire to protect and provide for me and the family? What have I said recently to communicate this?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4374">3. <b><i>A</i></b>uthority—Have I gone on record that, because he has the primary responsibility for me (even to die for me), I recognize him as having the primary authority? Do I let him be the leader? How have I helped in that regard recently?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4380">4. <b><i>I</i></b>nsight—Do I trust his ability to analyze things and offer solutions and not just depend on my “intuition”?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4386">5. <b><i>R</i></b>elationship—Do I spend shoulder-to-shoulder time with him whenever I can? Do I let him know that I am his friend as well as his lover?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e4392">6. <b><i>S</i></b>exuality—Do I honor his need for sexual release even when I don’t feel like it?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4398">As a husband spells out love to his wife through C-O-U-P-L-E and a wife spells out respect to her husband through C-H-A-I-R-S, they can’t help but meet each other’s needs. The beauty of it is, if you meet a need in your spouse, it will come back to you as your spouse meets one of your needs. The key is in always being willing to cut your spouse some slack, as this woman discovered:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4400">I think I might have just realized something. . . . It is not that my husband is not showing me love or trying to understand me. It is that I am back to that place where, if he doesn’t do it exactly the way I want it, it’s no good. Okay, I am an idiot! He is showing me love, kindness, etc., in many ways and I have chosen to focus on one thing that I don’t like! . . . So can you extend your 2x4 through the computer and hit me upside of the head?! What I need is to rejoice in the ways my husband shows his love for me and express my appreciation for those. Would you please pray for me to really get this, internalize it, act on it and have it be my <i>first</i> response instead of having the negative, critical spirit come first?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4405">I love this wife’s honesty, not to mention her insight. She realizes she is a lot like Eve, who had paradise but wanted more (see Genesis 3). In a fallen world, you cannot always have “more.” You can’t grasp the Holy Grail of perfection, which is always beyond your reach. But you can embrace Love and Respect, which will always provide <i>more than enough</i> to energize your marriage. Act on the principles embodied in C-O-U-P-L-E and C-H-A-I-R-S, and your relationship as husband and wife is bound to be less negative and more positive. (If you have not read appendix C yet, do so now to learn how to share your needs with each other.)</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4411">FROM THE ENERGIZING CYCLE TO THE REWARDED CYCLE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4413">In part 3, I will discuss how you can complete the Love and Respect process, which is designed to bring your marriage from bad to good, and from good to better. I will discuss how you can combine your faith with everything you have learned to bring you the reward of a happy marriage. I call this the Rewarded Cycle:</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4415">HIS LOVE BLESSES REGARDLESS OF HER RESPECT;<br />
  HER RESPECT BLESSES REGARDLESS OF HIS LOVE.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4419">The Rewarded Cycle will show you the best way to develop the ability to give your spouse what he or she needs most as you bring your faith in Christ directly into your acts of Love and Respect. You will learn how a husband’s unconditional love mirrors Christ’s love for the church and how a wife’s unconditional respect is like the church’s reverence for Christ. I will share how the Rewarded Cycle develops your inner maturity and freedom of spirit, how it can make you good examples to those around you, and how you can win your spouses in a wise way.</p>
