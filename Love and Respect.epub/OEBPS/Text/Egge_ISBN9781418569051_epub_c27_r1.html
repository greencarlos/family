  C-H-A-I-R-S: HOW TO SPELL<br />
  RESPECT TO YOUR HUSBAND</a></p>

  <p class="txc" id="d12e3155"><i>(Note to husbands: This chapter and the six to follow are “for wives only,” but husbands are invited to read along.)</i></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3158"><span class="dcap" id="d12e3159">L</span>adies, we have taken your husbands through C-O-U-P-L-E to help them become more loving men. Now it’s your turn. In the next six chapters, we will take you through the acronym C-H-A-I-R-S to give you practical, biblical ways that will help you become more respectful women.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3162">Wives do not need a lot of coaching on being loving. It is something God built into them, and they do it naturally. However, they do need help with respect. Part 1 contained many letters from wives who discovered the tremendous power in giving their husbands unconditional respect. Admittedly, this is a foreign term to many women, and even though you have bought into the idea that your husband wants and needs respect, it is still a difficult concept to practice.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3164"><i>“A wise woman builds her house.But a foolish woman tears hers down”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3167"><i>(Proverbs 14:1 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3170">This wife’s letter represents how many women feel as they attempt to get off the Crazy Cycle and on the Energizing Cycle:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3172">Applying respect in my marriage is quite foreign and I have really had to work at it. I always thought I just needed to love more. What a revelation for me, because loving more wasn’t helping. Thank you again! I am so excited about where our marriage will go from here as we apply what we have learned. I have a new energy for our relationship.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3174">Providing more energy for your marriage is exactly what the C-H-A-I-R-S chapters are all about. C-H-A-I-R-S is an acronym that stands for six major values that your husband holds: <b><i>C</i></b>onquest, <b><i>H</i></b>ierarchy, <b><i>A</i></b>uthority, <b><i>I</i></b>nsight, <b><i>R</i></b>elationship, and <b><i>S</i></b>exuality. Each of these values will be covered in a brief chapter. In <b><i>C</i></b>onquest, you will learn to appreciate his desire to work and achieve. <b><i>H</i></b>ierarchy deals with appreciating his desire to protect and provide. <b><i>A</i></b>uthority covers appreciating his desire to serve and to lead. <b><i>I</i></b>nsight touches on appreciating his desire to analyze and counsel. <b><i>R</i></b>elationship helps you understand his desire for shoulder-to-shoulder friendship. <b><i>S</i></b>exuality explains his desire for sexual intimacy. In these six areas, you will learn how to spell “respect” to your husband. (For how to share your needs with each other, see appendix C.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3226">Granted, “unconditional respect” almost sounds to some women like an oxymoron. After all, he should <i>earn</i> respect, not be given respect unconditionally, or so many women seem to think. Ever since I have started teaching the Love and Respect Connection, I have struggled with helping wives see what unconditional respect can do for their husbands—and their marriages. Giving your husband unconditional respect is the clear path to receiving unconditional love from him, but it is still hard for women to grasp. Here are reports from two wives who are reaping the benefits:</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3231"><i>When a wife “is clothed with . . . dignity,” she carries herself honorably and comes across respectfully (Proverbs 31:25 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3235">I kept trying to get some attention and affection. . . . One night a few weeks ago, he said to me for the hundredth time, “You never listen to me” as an explanation for that month’s ice cold treatment. That night I relistened to your “man” talk and I finally understood what he meant . . . what he was getting was a whole lot of badgering in [my] attempt to get closer to him. I immediately changed my approach [and] got very conscious of my choices and outcomes and the result has been wonderful . . . he has been very loving.</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3237">I am thankful for this concept of unconditional respect, because now I feel I can return, in a way that is meaningful to him, all the love he gives to me. . . . As a martial artist, I have learned a lot about respect, just didn’t realize it was a language. . . . I never knew it was a need, let alone a language. . . . I am learning to communicate more effectively with my teenage son as well, thanks to this new awareness of respect.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3239">How to Use the “Respect Test” with Your Husband</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3241">When I began teaching the Love and Respect Connection, I would talk to various groups and quote them the key passages: Ephesians 5:33 (“The wife must respect her husband” NIV) and 1 Peter 3:1–2 (“Wives, be submissive to your own husbands . . . as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior”). But, frankly, many women would dismiss these verses almost flippantly by pointing out that Paul was a male and so was Peter. How could they know how a woman felt?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3243">Instead of preaching sermons about not rebelling against inspired Scripture, I devised a way they could test the concept of unconditional respect with their husbands. Not surprisingly, I called it the “Respect Test.” I asked a group of wives to spend a bit of time thinking of some things they respected about their husbands. It took some of them quite awhile, but they all finally did it. Then I told them to go home, wait until their husbands weren’t busy or distracted, and say: “I was thinking about you today and several things about you that I respect, and I just want you to know that I respect you.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3245">After saying this, they were to not wait for any response—just mention something they needed to do and quietly start to leave the room. Then they were to see what would happen. One woman reported back to me that after telling her husband she respected him, she turned to leave but she never even made it to the door. He practically screamed, “Wait! Come back. <i>What</i> things?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3250">Fortunately (and this is very important), she was ready to tell him what she respected about him and she proceeded to do so. After she was finished, he said, “Wow! Hey, can I take the family out to dinner?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3252">The wife was aghast. Her husband had seldom if ever taken the family out to dinner. What was going on here? I explained to her that a man’s first and fundamental impulse is to serve, especially in response to being honored. She had honored him, and he wanted to do something about it. The wife had to ask for a rain check because the kids had commitments that evening, and he agreed. About fifteen minutes later, however, she heard pots and pans banging in the kitchen. She went to look and found her husband fixing dinner. Her husband had <i>never</i> fixed dinner. <i>Never</i>—this was a first! Again, he was serving.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3260"><i>When doing the Respect Test, you “. . . walk by faith, not by sight—”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3263"><i>(2 Corinthians 5:7).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3266">A few days later, this wife wrote to us again and said, “You won’t believe it. He’s in the laundry room! Do you have any other ‘respect tests’? I think I might get a cruise out of this.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3269">Could a wife use the Respect Test to manipulate her husband to take her on a cruise? That’s possible, but this wife was not guilty of manipulation. She sincerely tried expressing respect for her husband, and it worked far beyond her expectations. To repeat what I said earlier, a husband who has basic goodwill will serve his wife when she respects him for who he is. I am convinced that the key to motivating another person is meeting his or her deepest need.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3271">Granted, not every wife may get the same response that this woman received. Some husbands might mull over the Respect Test for a while and say something later. Or they might say nothing at all. The point is, using the Respect Test means taking a step of faith. It is admitting that you understand what God’s Word says about unconditional respect for your husband. You show him respect <i>regardless of his response</i>.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3276">Be Ready with Reasons That You Respect Him</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3278">When a wife tells her husband that there are several things that she respects about him, most husbands—after regaining consciousness—will instantly ask, “What were you thinking? What do you mean? What do you respect about me?” A wife needs to be prepared to answer these questions honestly and genuinely. Don’t expect to make your respect statement, head for the hills, and hope he never mentions it again. Trust me—that won’t happen.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3280">But what if a wife just doesn’t know what to say? We have talked with many wives who admit there just isn’t anything they really respect about their husbands. But a wife who says this is usually too angry or perhaps too discouraged to think about what she can respect in her husband. First, this kind of wife must ask herself, “Is my husband, as unaware and unloving as he is, a man of basic goodwill?” If the answer to this question is yes in any degree at all, then this wife can start making her list. It will help her to realize that her husband is made in the image of God, and he has God-given attributes that are worthy of respect. For example, he desires to work and achieve and to protect and provide for this family. He desires to be strong and to lead in the good sense of the word. We’ll look at these and other God-given male attributes in following chapters. The point is this: <i>look at his desires and not his performance</i>. Here are some thoughts to get you started. You can frame them in your own particular words.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3285">“Honey, I respect how you get up every day and go to work to provide for our family. This isn’t an option; you have to do it and you do.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3287">“Honey, I respect you for your desire to protect me and provide for me and the family. I think of all the insurance you have for us. I know the bills weigh on you at times, and I admire you for your commitment.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3289">The key is to focus on the positive instead of always going back to the negative. A wife must try to see what God sees. Is your husband basically a man of goodwill? Get in touch with that fact and express respect for it. A Scripture passage I often reference regarding goodwill in marriage is 1 Corinthians 7:33–34. Paul assumes that married couples in Corinth have goodwill toward each other. He points out that an unmarried man has more time for doing the Lord’s work but that a married man “is concerned about . . . how he may please his wife” (v. 33). Paul goes on to say that it is the same for a wife who “is concerned about . . . how she may please her husband” (v. 34).<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5438" id="d12e3291">1</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3294">A good-willed husband does not try to displease his wife but to please her, as Paul clearly states in 1 Corinthians 7:33. I always urge a wife who is feeling unloved to be slow in asserting that her husband is unloving or does not want to love her. That is impugning an evil motive upon her husband, which is too drastic a judgment. True, a husband may not be as loving as he ought to be, but he is not consciously, willfully, and habitually trying to be unloving and displeasing. During those moments when a husband displeases a wife or a wife displeases her husband, it helps to keep certain scriptures in mind: “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak (Matthew 26:41) and “Indeed, there is not a righteous man [<i>or woman</i>] on earth who continually does good and who never sins” (Ecclesiastes 7:20; italics mine).<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5442" id="d12e3299">2</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3302">When a husband gets angry or stubborn, his wife must realize he is not set on a course to hurt her. He tries to be well-meaning. He wants a happy marriage. And because he wants that happy marriage, wives who try the Respect Test can be amazed at what will happen. Men are starving for respect. One wife who attended one of our conferences wrote to me and reported what happened when she used the Respect Test. Instead of talking to him, she typed up a card that told her husband how much she respected him for working so hard to provide for the family and letting her be a stay-at-home mom for their three daughters. She tucked it in his briefcase, and he y found it the next day by midmorning. Immediately, he called her on his cell phone and thanked her for making his whole day.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3304"><i>When a wife wisely applies respect, she is “a wise wife . . . given by the LORD”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3308"><i>(Proverbs 19:14 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3311">I could give you many other reports from wives who tried the Respect Test and passed with flying colors. Some have done it face to face, others have written notes, and others have called their husband at work and left a respect message on his voicemail. It doesn’t matter how a wife uses the Respect Test, but when she does, it can be the first step toward a real breakthrough in the marriage. One wife wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3313">Just a few days ago, I decided to tell my husband that I respect him. It felt so awkward to say the words, but I went for it and the reaction was unbelievable! He asked me why I respected him. I listed off a few things, although I could have said many more, and I watched his demeanor change right before my very eyes!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3315">If your relationship has been unfulfilling, try to think back to the point where it lost its intimacy. You may remember feeling wounded in spirit because you did not feel your husband loved you in a meaningful way, and you reacted. Ever since, the Crazy Cycle has spun for you to one degree or another. This wife admitted:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3317">We’ve been living in the Crazy Cycle for more years than you can imagine. I’ve already respected him; I just wasn’t showing it because I felt so unloved. I guess it was my way of retaliating, but I honestly didn’t know it. As I [started] really looking at him during some interactions I was shocked at the look on his face. I saw that he felt disrespected! How could I never see it before? The best way I can describe what I see happening now is that he is melting, and I feel hope for the first time in years.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3319">This wife found the way off the Crazy Cycle! The following chapters are designed to help you start practicing respect for your husband in ways that will energize him and your marriage. The word <i>C-H-A-I-R-S</i> describes the typical man. Yes, I know there are exceptions, but men, in general, see themselves as the ones who should “chair” the relationship. That may not be politically correct, but we’re not here to discuss political correctness. We’re here to discuss the way things are—the way men and women feel in their souls. We’ve looked at how women feel in their souls, and now we must consider how men feel. Neither is wrong; they’re just as different as pink and blue.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3324"><i>A husband wants to be seen as one “who manages his own household well” (1 Timothy 3:4).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3327">In most cases, men see themselves in the driver’s seat. Whether they are any good at chairing the relationship and being in the driver’s seat can be debated. But in terms of a man’s self-image, he needs to be the chairman; he needs to drive. He needs to be first among equals, not to be superior or dominating but because this is how God has made him and he wants to take on that responsibility. Keep this vital fact in mind as you read through the six concepts that follow, which will explain how to spell respect to a man and get you both on the Energizing Cycle. As these concepts unfold, you will get a clearer picture of who your husband is and how God has made him (and your son if you have one). And, as you practice these concepts, you may well enjoy what many wives have experienced. For example:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3329">We have never had a marriage that was close and intimate [and loving] until I began practicing respect. I always knew that something was lacking, but figured it was him [being unloving] and not me [being disrespectful]. Now I feel loved and I know he feels respected and a tremendous void has been filled in our lives.</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3331">Your comment [was] that it is easier for men to respect their wives than to love them, and easier for wives to love their husbands than to respect them. I have never come across that thought, ever before. It was really striking to me. This was really, really important.</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3333">My husband and I are enjoying such a sweeter relationship these days. I have learned to be keenly aware of what I am communicating (including facial expressions and tone of voice) and my husband has responded by allowing me to tell him when I am feeling unloved. We have avoided the Crazy Cycle completely since I committed to be obedient to God in this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3336">Those are just a few of dozens of such comments that we have received. As Dale Carnegie once said, “Truly respecting others is the bedrock of motivation.” It is also the key to getting off the Crazy Cycle and on the Energizing Cycle. Read on and learn specific ways to motivate your husband to love you as never before.</p>
