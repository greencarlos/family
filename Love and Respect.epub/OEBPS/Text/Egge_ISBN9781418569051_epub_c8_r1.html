  <p class="ser"><img alt="1591451876_ePDF_0008_002" id="d12e294" src="../Images/1591451876_ePDF_0008_002.jpg" /></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e295">For their untold hours of editing and typing, my heartfelt thanks to my good friends, Fritz and Jackie Ridenour. Both are gifts of God to me. They grabbed the vision and would not let go, despite incredible deadline pressures. Without them, this book could not have been completed. They have brought me joy.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e297">I am exceedingly grateful to God for the affirmation and support of our hometown friends in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I love and respect Dick and Betsy DeVos, Kevin and Meg Cusack, and Jim and Betty Buick. From the inception, they believed!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e299">At a CEO event by Focus on the Family I met Michael Coleman, CEO of Integrity Media, and his lovely wife, Jeannie. Michael invited me to consider Integrity Publishers. I did, and more! To his outstanding staff, I salute you! Let’s make a difference with this message.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e301">That Focus on the Family is sponsoring the Love and Respect Marriage Conferences is such an encouragement. That they are putting their seal of approval on this book is so honoring. Thank you, Dr. Dobson and Don Hodel. With you, I am praying we reach young and old.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e303">I am indebted to Sealy Yates, my agent-lawyer, and his office staff. The role he plays in dotting the I’s and giving counsel is unquestionably treasured. Beyond that, his jolly laugh and smiling face bring cheer to each conversation.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e305">To Erinn Swett, my assistant, thanks for competently handling the office while I was writing this book. I am grateful to God for your leadership and giftedness.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e307">To the board of Love and Respect Ministries, I express my appreciation. You have made decisions that continue to advance this worthy cause. There is wisdom in many counselors. Your advice is invaluable.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e309">I thank my children, Jonathan, David, and Joy, for standing with Mom and me. You have blessed us as we have watched you promote the Love and Respect message. Thanks for making this vision your vision. And to David, welcome aboard as a new staff person!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e311">To my sister, I clap my hands in applause. Ann, you have helped me whenever and wherever. I am blessed! Thanks for finding me so many jokes!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e314">My mom and dad are now in heaven. While on earth, both were a testimony to what God can do through two people who open their hearts to Him. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for looking beyond yourselves to God. Later in life, you chose to be faithful to the end.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e316">I am beholden to you who have told me your personal stories of Love and Respect in marriage. Your testimonies will not only help others but have made this book very inviting. As a vice president at Integrity Publishers wrote, “The testimonial letters throughout not only serve as insightful illustrations, but provide dramatic high points along the way. Captivating.” Thank you.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e318">Sarah and I will never know on this side of eternity the impact that is being made because of you—our friends—who prayed for us. You know who you are. We humbly thank you. Remember us still.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e320">In the movie <i>Chariots of Fire—</i>about the life of Eric Liddell, the Olympic runner who refused to race on Sundays—the Bible is quoted: “For those who honor Me I will honor” (1 Samuel 2:30). Reader, I wish to acknowledge and honor God. This message on Love and Respect comes from His heart in Ephesians 5:33. This book would not exist if God had not graciously illumined me to His revelation. Though the application of these two truths is my frail attempt to serve you, the essential truths themselves will never change—not any more than God changes. Lord, I thank You most of all and forevermore.</p>
