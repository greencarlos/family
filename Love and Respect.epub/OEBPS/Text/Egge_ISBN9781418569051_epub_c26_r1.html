  <br />
  ESTEEM—SHE WANTS YOU TO<br />
  HONOR AND CHERISH HER</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2939"><span class="dcap" id="d12e2940">O</span>ver the years, many men have come to me and said, “You know, Pastor, my prayer life isn’t what it should be.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2943">I respond, “How are you treating your wife?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2945">“No, no,” the husband hastens to explain. “My prayer life isn’t where it ought to be.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2947">“How are you treating your wife?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2949">“No, no, Pastor, I’m saying my prayer life; I’m not talking about my wife.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2951">I smile and say, “I <i>am</i> talking about your wife.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2956">In part 1, we talked about scriptural reasons that husbands are to value their wives as equals. The major passage we looked at was 1 Peter 3:7, which tells husbands to live in an understanding way with their wives, “ . . . and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life.” Tucked into 1 Peter 3:7 is one more phrase that every husband should</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2958">yheed. Peter adds that the reason the husband should treat his wife in an understanding way, as a fellow heir in Christ, is so that his “prayers will not be hindered.” That is why I would often tell men who came to see me for counsel that, if heaven seemed silent to their prayers, perhaps they were not honoring their wives as God intended.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2960"><i>ORD looks with favor on those who are godly. His ears are open to their cry”(Psalm 34:15 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2963">These men were sure they were doing all the right things, walking in integrity, and serving the Lord, but when they prayed, the heavens seemed as brass. They kept wondering, “God, why aren’t You hearing me?” And as we probed a little deeper, we often saw that the answer for these men was that they weren’t living with their wives in an understanding way that honored and esteemed them. As soon as these men started obeying Scripture, their prayer life improved.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2966">THE C-O-U-P-L-E PRINCIPLES ARE CONNECTED</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2968">In a very real sense, the C-O-U-P-L-E acronym is a commentary on the best way to show respect to a wife. The best way to respect or honor a wife is through your <b><i>C</i></b>loseness, <b><i>O</i></b>penness, <b><i>U</i></b>nderstanding, <b><i>P</i></b>eace-making, <b><i>L</i></b>oyalty, and now <b><i>E</i></b>—for <b><i>E</i></b>steem. A wife who is esteemed will not sing Aretha Franklin’s refrain, “R-E-S-P-E-C-T.” Scripture speaks of how a man should esteem and cherish his beloved. “How beautiful and how delightful you are, My love, with all your charms!” (Song of Solomon 7:6). A husband is to be one who “cherishes” his wife (Ephesians 5:29).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2999">In the well-known passage of Proverbs 31, verses 28-29 say, “Her children stand up and call her blessed. Her husband also rises up, and he praises her. He says, ‘Many women do noble things. But you are better than all the others’” (NIRV).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3001">God has made women so that they want to be esteemed, honored, and respected. The way to honor your wife, as well as to honor your covenant with God, is to treasure her. When I say your wife wants “honor” (respect), it is a different kind of honor from what you seek as a man. For her, respect is a part of love. Probably the only time you will ever hear her say, “You don’t respect me!” is when you dismiss her opin- ion. Actually, her exact words might be: “I know you don’t love me because you don’t even respect me!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3003">Respect, honor, and esteem are not qualities in and of themselves for your wife; they are components of the love she wants from you. To put it another way, love has many parts, and we are looking at six of them here with the acronym C-O-U-P-L-E. In chapters 15 and following, we will talk about how a wife spells respect to her husband with the acronym C-H-A-I-R-S. Something in his nature feels called to “chair” the relationship. He does not feel this in the sense of “being superior.” He simply feels responsible to protect her and to die for her. God has made husbands this way, and they feel this responsibility equally.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3005">The biblical view is that a wife does not feel called to die for her husband as he feels called to die for her. In Ephesians 5, the husband is the Christ figure; Christ died for the church. The wife is the church figure, and her husband is to die for her. Your wife does not want to chair the relationship, but she does want to be first in importance to you. This is what Peter means by “show her honor” (1 Peter 3:7). Your wife wants to know that you have her on your mind and heart <i>first and foremost</i>. This is what I mean by “esteem”; when it’s there, your wife will feel treasured as if she’s the most loved woman on earth. Also, she will want to respect you in a similar way that the church reverences Christ. Remember that your love motivates her respect, and her respect motivates your love!</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3010">OUR KIDS OFTEN MADE SARAH FEEL LIKE A FAILURE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3012">On many occasions while our children were growing up, Sarah would get discouraged with her mothering role. When the kids got into trouble, caused trouble, or were just plain trouble, as kids can be, she felt inadequate, and that flowed into self-depreciation. She would say, “I feel like such a failure.” When our kids were very young, I used to ignore Sarah’s complaints or play them down as “no big deal.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3014">But as our two sons and daughter got into the teenage years, I began understanding what Sarah wanted when she came to me to say she felt like a failure or that she was “no good” as a mom. She wanted reassurance that I believed in her and the course she was taking in her role as a mother. She just wanted to know if I had confidence in the decisions she was making or was I second-guessing her. I continually let her know that I valued her efforts and commitment and that I prized her and the part she played in my life as well as in the lives of the children. I knew I could not do her job, and I often told her so.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3016">The Love and Respect Connection can help you have an enjoyable, healthy, meaningful marriage relationship. Life, however, will never be totally perfect. When Adam and Eve fell in the Garden, sin became the universal problem for all of us (see Genesis 3; Romans 5:12–20). Tension, conflict, and problems will occur, and you must be prepared to deal with all of it. As the husband, you tie your self-image into who you are in the field—that is, in work, in accomplishments, in conquests (see chapter 16). Your wife, however, ties her self-worth into who she is in the family. Yes, it is true that today many women have careers and important positions outside of the home, but one woman who was the vice president of a major airline said it well: “At the end of the day, all that’s important is that I know he loves me and values me. That’s what I want more than anything else.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3018">USE SYMBOLS TO SHOW YOUR WIFE ESTEEM</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3021">After getting out of military school and entering Wheaton College, I began asking, “Who are these people called women?” I had been withdrawn from them in military school from age thirteen to eighteen. I had a lot of questions that most guys weren’t asking. I can recall being in the dining hall with a bunch of the guys and asking, “Why do you give a girl a rose after a fight?” They all gave me a blank look, and finally one of them said, “I don’t know, it just works. Pass the bread.” But I wouldn’t give it up. I knew there was a symbolism here that I did not understand. Giving roses to a man typically doesn’t cause him to tear up and need a handkerchief.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3023"></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3024">Later, after meeting and marrying Sarah, I learned a lot more about the power of symbolism and how it conveys to a woman that you value her and love her. You will never be able to show her the amount of emotional openness and esteem that she really wants—no man could—but symbolic things can do a great deal to bridge the gap. I am talking particularly about anniversaries and birthdays. Women put great store in these occasions (remember my magnificent goof by forgetting Sarah’s birthday?).</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3026"><i>“Keep me close to yourself like the ring on your finger”(Song of Solomon 8:6 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3029">Women are the ones who have babies, and that’s one reason that birthdays are a big deal to them. For nine months she is asked, “When is the due date?” Birth is part of the culture of women. Only women give birth. As Jeremiah observed, “Ask now, and see, if a male can give birth” (Jeremiah 30:6). In a woman’s mind, who could possibly forget a birthday? She never would.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3031">Much the same way, a marriage date is etched in the woman’s soul. Since childhood, your wife dreamed of the wedding day as she played dress-up and sang, “Here Comes the Bride!” Even today, your wife will show wedding pictures to her friends. They will talk about her dress, her hairdo back then, etc. Husbands, however, never played dress-up in tuxes. Husbands do not say, “Hey, Harry, let me show you what the guys wore in my wedding.” This is a graphic illustration of pink and blue, and you should be aware of it. For your wife, there are no more important dates than your wedding anniversary and her birthday, as well as the birthdays of others in the family. All of these dates are opportunities for you to show her that you love and esteem her by remembering them and celebrating them with her.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3033"></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3034"><i>“Does a young woman forget all about her jewelry? Does a bride forget her wedding jewels?”(Jeremiah 2:32 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3037">How you celebrate her birthday or your anniversary is an art, not a science. The scientific approach puts a lot of stock in the material, the expensive. Suppose one man buys his wife a Mercedes for her birthday (I can think of three men I know who did just that). The y other man takes his wife out to the park and they go for a nice walk and share feelings of love and closeness as he tells her how much she means to him. On the way back to the car, he finds a small, flat rock, picks it up, and brings it home. Then he writes a little poem or some other notation on it and presents it to her as a memento of the walk they took that day. Whose wife will appreciate her gift the most?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3039">The natural male (blue) inclination is to think that the expensive gift would be far more meaningful to a wife. After all, if you bought another man a Mercedes, he’d go around telling all of his friends, “Wow! What a great guy Joe is. I can’t believe it. He gave me this wonderful car!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3041">But when you buy a woman a Mercedes, she is much more likely to say to her girlfriends, “Look, he got me a Mercedes. I wonder if he is trying to buy me off or something.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3044">Let’s get back to that little rock. When she’s ninety-three and you’ve been dead for a decade, what is she going to keep on her mantel? A picture of the Mercedes? Absolutely not! She’s going to keep that rock, because it is symbolic of a time when her husband gave her special attention, devotion, and esteem.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3046">One husband attended our conference with his wife of twenty-four years and quickly grasped the power of “little, thoughtful things.” His wife wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3048">Valentine’s Day was very unique. . . . I woke up to a candy scavenger hunt. My husband had taken the time to write four short poems and attached each to a baggie filled with four different kinds of Valentine candy. . . . It started in the bathroom . . . and had clues of where to find the next. I just giggled around the house, it was so fun. . . . That night my husband made reservations to go to a Valentine supper. A classic guitarist played; they took our picture and put it in a special “thank you” frame from the restaurant. We feasted on wonderful food in a very relaxed atmosphere. It was absolutely one of the most memorable evenings! Thank you for encouraging my husband to love me.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3050">This woman’s words illustrate a key truth: the expense of a gift is secondary to the thought your wife senses you put into the gift, card, or activity. God designed your wife to be touched by things that symbolize your love and show that you treasure her. She wants to know you think about her. She wants that to come from your heart without any prompting. Truly, it is the thought that counts!</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3052">DOES YOUR WIFE EVER WANT YOU TO READ HER MIND?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3054">The Valentine story above is what can happen when all goes well. Sometimes, however, Murphy’s Law kicks in—at least a little bit. To illustrate, I’ll stay with the theme of taking your wife out to dinner. Suppose it’s your fifth anniversary and you come home and say, “Honey, I want to take you out for dinner for our anniversary. Where do you want to go?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3056">She says, “Oh, I don’t know.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3058">You respond, “No, I really want to take you wherever you want. Where would you like to go?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3060">She says again, “I don’t know; why don’t you decide?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3062">“You want me to decide?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3064">“Yes, I do.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3067">“But I don’t want to decide. I want to take you where <i>you</i> want to go.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3072">“No, I want you to decide,” your wife insists.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3074">Okay, you decide: “Well, I just read that the Freeway Steak House has the best beef in town. Why don’t we try it?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3076">And she says, “I don’t want to go there.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3078">A lot of husbands—maybe most husbands—have been in situations similar to this. At this point you can go in one of two directions: You can process your wife’s seemingly maddening response by getting irritated and even angry. Equipped to see and hear in blue, you can think that your wife should <i>know</i> she can’t be so unreasonable, illogical, and provoking. If she wants to ruin the evening, she has both of you halfway to the Crazy Cycle already.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3083">But there is another choice. You can weight the scales in favor of the Energizing Cycle. You can remember that your wife sees and hears in pink. You can adjust your blue sunglasses and blue hearing aids and be patient. Instead of getting irritated, you seek a little more information.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3085">Now in truth, your wife really wants you to sort of “read her mind.” She is thinking, <i>If he loved me as much as I love him, he’d figure out where I want to go without my having to tell him. That’s what I’d do for him. Why can’t he do that for me? I want to know he really thinks about me as I think about him and feels about me as I feel about him.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3089">Every husband has been expected to read his wife’s mind. Though mind reading seldom is possible, there are ways to make good guesses. You can say, “Okay, the Freeway Steak House is pretty limited, just steak and ribs. How about . . . ?” and then you name two or three other restaurants that have ambience and atmosphere, as well as a broader menu. Chances are you’ll hit the jackpot with one of these and she’ll say, “Okay, that sounds good.” Your fifth anniversary is saved from disaster and, even more important, your wife feels that you hold her in high esteem—that you really treasure her and want her to be happy.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3091">There are other situations, however, where your wife doesn’t want you to read her mind, but she still strongly disagrees with you. This can get a little sticky. How do you treat her with esteem if her opinion conflicts with yours (or possibly even sounds a little wacky)? Because males tend to be so bottom-line, it would be easy to sound harsh without even realizing it. Actually, there are three ways you can answer a wife when you don’t agree with her, and they can all keep her esteem intact. First, you can simply say, “Honey, thanks for sharing your opinion.” Second, you might say, “Honey, let me think about that.” That tells her you are processing her ideas. Third, and possibly best, you say, “Sweetheart, even though I don’t feel the same way you do about this, I value your opinion and I trust your heart.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3093">THANK HER FOR ALL SHE DOES</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3095">One other way to esteem your wife is to let her know you really appreciate all she does. You may have heard the story of the husband who came home from work to find bikes and scooters blocking the driveway, the house in shambles, dirty dishes stacked in the sink, dirty laundry piled up, pieces of clothing scattered everywhere, and his two preschool children drawing on the walls. He finally found his wife, asleep in bed. He woke her up and asked, “Honey, the place is a disaster, the kids are running wild—what is going on?!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3098">She looked at him with a wan, tired smile. “Well, you know how you always come home and you ask me what I did all day?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3100">He says, “Yeah . . . ”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3102">“Well, today I didn’t do it.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3104">Esteem your wife for what she does, but don’t overlook cherishing her simply for who she is. One woman said to her husband, “I just got off the phone with my sister. She’s incredible. She tells me that she helped her husband build a back porch on their house this summer.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3106"></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3107"><i>“Rejoice in the wife of your youth”(Proverbs 5:18b).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3110">She also made a rocking chair, and she’s in an exotic foods cooking class. She’s always doing something, making something. I feel so inadequate when I talk with her. What do <i>I</i> make?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3115">Her husband turned to her and said, “You make me happy.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3117">Bingo! Bonus points for that husband! He knows how to esteem his wife. Following are more ideas on how to esteem, cherish, and honor the most important person in your life.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3119">YOUR WIFE WILL FEEL ESTEEMED WHEN . . .</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3121">• you say, “I’m so proud of the way you handled that.”</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3124">• you speak highly of her in front of others.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3126">• you open the door for her.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3128">• you try something new with her.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3130">• you give her encouragement or praise with kindness and enthusiasm.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3132">• you notice something different about her hair or clothes.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3136">• you teach the children to show her and others respect.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3138">• you value her opinion in the gray areas as not wrong but just different—and valid.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3140">• you choose family outings over “guy things.”</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3142">• you make her feel first in importance.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3144">• you are proud of her and all she does.</p>
