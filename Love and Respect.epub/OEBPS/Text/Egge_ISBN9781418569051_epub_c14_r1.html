  WHAT MEN FEAR MOST<br />
  CAN KEEP THE CRAZY CYCLE<br />
  SPINNING</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1187"><span class="dcap" id="d12e1188">I</span>n chapter 2, I mentioned that many husbands interpret criticism as contempt, and contempt is something men do not handle well. Wives must grasp that their husbands aren’t half as big and strong and impervious to being hurt as they might seem. A woman may envision herself as a sweet little dewdrop and her man as a big, strong bear who should be able to absorb any kind of punishment. One huge fellow was stunned by his beloved’s attack and said to her, “You hate me.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1191">Frustrated, she replied, “When I scream ‘I hate you,’ you should know I don’t mean it. You are 6’9” and weigh 260 pounds, for goodness’ sake. I do that because you can take it.” The truth is, however, a lot of men can’t take it. No matter how big they may be physically, emotionally they are vulnerable to what sounds like contempt.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1193">The male fear of contempt is dramatized in the first chapter of Esther. What was the fear? That wives would start to despise their husbands and defy them. The result: there would be no end to the contempt and anger poured out by wives on their husbands throughout the king’s realm (see Esther 1:18). This is not to justify the male fear of contempt in the book of Esther or anywhere else. But as women fear being unloved, men fear being disrespected (held in contempt). The yearning and need of husbands is that their wives give them honor and respect.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1195">CONFLICT MAKES MOST MEN FEEL DISRESPECTED</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1197">When Decision Analysts, Inc., did a national survey on male-female relationships, I had the opportunity to contribute a question that was asked of a large representative sampling of men. The question read:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1199">Even the best relationships sometimes have conflicts on day-to-day issues. In the middle of a conflict with my wife/significant other, I am more likely to be feeling:</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e1201">(a) that my wife/significant other doesn’t respect me right now.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e1203">(b) that my wife/significant other doesn’t love me right now.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1205">Not surprisingly, 81.5 percent chose “(a) that my wife . . . doesn’t respect me right now.”<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5335" id="d12e1207">1</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1210">The survey substantiated what I already had discovered in my years of working with married couples. Men need to feel respected during conflict more than they need to feel loved. This does not mean men do not need love. As I already mentioned, men know deep down that their wives love them, but they are not at all that sure that their wives respect them. Perhaps that’s why they favored answer (a) over answer (b) by such a great majority. Whatever the reason, during marital conflict, it is clear that men place a higher value on feeling respected than on feeling loved. Many women cannot imagine this because they are still tuned into the love wavelength.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1213">Practically every woman I have met or counseled would be willing to say, “I just want somebody to love me, to make me special, to make me the most important one in his life.” No one seizes on these words and accuses women of being prima donnas or egomaniacs. Yet when a man says he needs to be respected, he is often labeled, especially in our culture, as arrogant.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1215">But it’s amazing what happens when a woman gives a man respect and admiration. Just go back to your days of courting. During courtship the woman may have thought that her man was motivated to ask her to marry him because of her love. After all, love is what motivated her. In fact, her love was huge; there is no question about that. But more than she ever realized, it was her unique and intimate admiration that won her man’s heart. The old saying puts it: “Every man does what he does for the admiration of one woman.” Back in courtship days, she became that woman and he bowed the knee and proposed. He felt deep feelings of love for her, but they came out of his being convinced that she respected him and admired him. She was striking a chord deep within him that literally drove his life then as it drives his life today.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1217"><i>Wives virtually ask to be unloved when they “look down on their husbands”(Esther 1:17 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1220">I believe that men hold respect and honor as almost equal values. My experience as a man, and with other men, tells me that in our arena we have an honor code, and if we don’t live by that honor code, we’re in big trouble. We have learned from boyhood that there are certain things you just don’t do, certain things you just don’t say. A woman will talk to a husband in the home in the way that a man would never talk to him. He can’t believe she can be so belligerent, so disrespectful.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1222">The husband will often look away, wanting to drop the argument and move on. He doesn’t want to talk about it. Why? Because he feels engulfed and overpowered by his wife’s dark countenance, negative emotions, and combative words. All this annoys and incites him. So he withdraws. To him, that is the honorable thing to do.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1224">ARE YOU A CRITICIZER OR A STONEWALLER?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1226">According to John Gottman’s extensive research, 85 percent of husbands eventually stonewall their wives during conflict. For a man, tension builds faster because his blood pressure and heart rate rise much higher and stay elevated much longer than his wife’s.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1228">During tense exchanges, a wife’s negative criticism can overwhelm the husband and he has little appetite to deal with it. The wife sees such exchanges as potentially increasing love between them, and her heartbeats per minute (BPM) do not escalate. The husband, on the other hand, sees the exchange as an argument in which he is apt to lose respect, and this revs up his BPMs.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1230"><i>David’s wife asked for the Crazy Cycle when “she despised him in her heart” (2 Samuel 6:16).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1233">In an attempt to calm himself down, the husband will stonewall—become quiet, say nothing, or go off by himself. If asked why he has stonewalled, the husband will say something like, “I’m trying not to react.” The wife may see her husband’s stonewalling as unloving, but he does not. He is simply trying to do the honorable and respectable thing, but his wife thinks he’s rejecting her. How could he possibly want to withdraw and stonewall her when all she has done is given him a minor criticism or two?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1235">Gottman states, “Such interactions can produce a vicious cycle, especially in marriage with high levels of conflict. The more wives complain and criticize, the more husbands withdraw and stonewall; the more husbands withdraw and stonewall, the more wives complain and criticize.”<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5342" id="d12e1237">2</a></sup>Gottman adds that if a wife becomes belligerent and con temptuous, the marriage is in serious danger. If this cycle isn’t broken, it will probably end in divorce.<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5349" id="d12e1241">3</a></sup></p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1245">HOW WOMEN DEAL WITH CONFLICT BETWEEN THEMSELVES</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1247">My experience in counseling hundreds of marriages over the years confirms that husbands are, indeed, masterful stonewallers as a rule. Their wives, of course, are usually the ones who are the criticizers, the confronters, the ones who want to get things out on the table and get them settled. There are wives who stonewall at times, but in my experience, they are in the minority. My view is that when a wife does stonewall, she does so because she has lost confidence that her husband will hear her heart. She longs to connect but has given up hope. While his heart rate may be going through the roof, hers is slow and steady because her heart is broken. (See appendix D, p. 317.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1249">In the majority of cases, a wife who is in love with her husband will move toward him when she feels unloved. For example, it’s the first year of marriage and he has been late to dinner two nights in a row without calling. She says to herself, <i>This is wrong. How can he be so insensitive? Am I last on his priority list? This is so unloving.</i> Instinctively, she proceeds to say what she believes is the loving thing when he comes through the door: “We need to talk. We need to talk right now. Please sit down and talk to me!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1254">In approaching her husband in this fashion, the wife is using the same approach she would use with a best girlfriend. When women have conflicts with each other, they both usually verbalize their feelings. They share what is on their hearts because instinctively they know it will eventually lead to reconciliation. At some point, one of them will say, “Well, I was wrong.” Then the other will say, “No, I was wrong too. Will you forgive me?” And the other one says, “Yes, of course I’ll forgive you. I’m really sorry.” Then they hug, shed a few tears, and pretty soon they’re laughing.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1256">That’s what I call bringing things full circle. Unfortunately, women think this approach will work with their husbands just as well as it does with their best girlfriends. When a problem arises and something feels unloving, the wife instinctively moves toward her husband to share her feelings. Her eventual goal is that both of them will apologize and then embrace. This is the way she keeps her marriage up-to-date—a high value for her. Her heart longs to resolve things and to reconcile. Her husband matters to her more than any other adult on earth. In truth, her confrontation is a compliment. She thinks, <i>Oh, that he could see my heart! Why does he close himself off from me?</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1260">What a wife usually fails to see is that a big difference exists between her best girlfriend and her husband. A wife will be more judgmental toward her husband than toward her best girlfriend. She feels free to do this because, as his loving helpmate, part of her mission, in her mind, is to “help” change him into a loving man. She knows that if she can just get her criticisms out on the table, he can change. And if he’ll change to be a bit more loving, she knows she will still outlove him.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1262">A WIFE’S SELF-IMAGE MAY DEPEND ON HER HUSBAND’S APPROVAL</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1264">The typical wife also fails to realize that her self-image often rests on what she believes her husband thinks of her. This is not the case with a girlfriend. Her girlfriend’s opinion of her is important, but not as vital as her husband’s opinion.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1266">Also, the marriage relationship, unlike her relationship to a girlfriend, is a topic of ongoing discussion between her and other women. Women want to report to each other how wonderful their marriages are. So a wife’s negativity can intensify when her husband stonewalls her efforts to get him to change. He isn’t making her feel good, and she can’t report to her friends the joys of her marriage. If her negativity intensifies, she is in danger of becoming even more belligerent and contemptuous, and then her husband will close her off completely.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1268">Proverbs 21:19 says, “It is better to live in a desert land than with a contentious and vexing woman.” The sad irony is that a wife can become “contentious and vexing” because her husband misinterprets her. He doesn’t decipher the code in which she cries, “I need your love.” Instead, he hears, “I don’t respect you.” This sweet, tender, godly woman is misunderstood. When she gets too negative, she does herself—and her marriage—no favors.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1270">Thankfully, some women are becoming aware that negative confrontation doesn’t work. As one wife said:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1273">My strength and verbal skills aren’t helping my marriage. I have come across to my husband as too strong and too controlling and too demanding and too critical. I have been his mommy and his teacher and his holy spirit. It’s my own personal nature to lead and direct and control and fix and do right and make others do the same. He is scared of my tongue.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1275">A WIFE’S SCOLDING CAN START THE CRAZY CYCLE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1277">When a man begins to feel that his wife no longer looks up to him but is looking down at him, the Crazy Cycle kicks in. The Crazy Cycle often starts when women start scolding in their homes. The word <i>scold</i> is often associated with mothers bawling out their children; the dictionary definition, however, says that scolding means to reprimand or criticize harshly and usually angrily and even openly. When a wife comes at a husband with repeated reprimands and “scolding,” this is a surefire way not only to annoy him but to treat him with disrespect. Wives, however, tend not to see this. As mothers, correction is part of their maternal nature. Unfortunately, they tend to mother their husbands also, as this mother admits:</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1282"><i>A wife “who brings shame” on her husband “is like sickness in his bones”(Proverbs 12:4 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1285">As I sat at the conference and listened to you speak about love for a wife, I had no problem hearing and agreeing with everything you were saying. Then on Saturday when you started talking about respect and the lack thereof, I have to be honest, I was taken aback. I was so focused on why he couldn’t understand me that I was totally missing that he was feeling put down. I think this is especially true for me. As a mother of young children, I am forever trying to make them understand right from wrong. I never realized that I had been projecting that onto my husband as well. In all honesty, I don’t think my husband really knew how to explain how my behavior was making him feel.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1287">When a wife scolds her husband, she’s only trying to help correct things, to keep things on an even keel. And there is no doubt at times men need this kind of help. But when a man begins to feel that what his wife is saying reduces him to a child being scolded, there can be trouble. He doesn’t necessarily see his wife’s heart; he only hears her words, which are saying that she’s looking down on him. To paraphrase Proverbs, he would rather live in the wilderness than with this irritating woman. While many wives do not intend to be disrespectful, they appear that way to their husbands, and their husbands take refuge in stonewalling them. (For tips on how not to criticize or stonewall your spouse, see appendix A, p. 305.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1289">I’ve asked any number of businessmen, “Do you want your associates to love you or respect you?” They all laugh and say, “I could care less if they love me, but respect me? Absolutely!” Right or wrong, men interpret their world through the respect grid, and a wife’s softened tone and facial expressions can do more for her marriage than she can imagine.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1291">Sarah was talking to a wife about controlling her verbal venom toward her husband. The wife was showing disdain for him, which she knew was not wise. But her husband did things that made her so angry. In her view, the problem was strictly with him. He didn’t clean up the kitchen right, he didn’t put the dishes in the dishwasher correctly, and he didn’t pick up after himself the way she expected, so she had turned sour and negative. The wife heard what Sarah was trying to say, but she felt overcome by her anger and hurt.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1293">So Sarah asked this wife a question she asks many women who arrive at our conferences full of contempt for their husbands: “What if your son grew up and married someone like you?” The woman’s mouth fell open. She was stunned. For the first time, she saw it! She would <i>never</i> want any woman to treat her son the way she was treating her husband. She realized that when her son became a husband, if his wife treated him with such anger and contempt, his spirit would be crushed and he would shut down in defeat. When she heard it put this way, a completely new view surfaced. She saw herself more clearly than ever before, and she vowed to change.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1298"><i>As a retort to his wife’s contempt, David communicates that he “will be held in honor”(2 Samuel 6:22 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1301">This lady is a vivid example of many wives who come to our conferences. They have mixed emotions. They love their husbands, yes, but respect them? No. That is why we constantly encourage wives to ask themselves one question: “Is what I’m about to say or do going to come across as respectful or disrespectful?” This prevents a wife from misrepresenting her heart by coming across too negatively.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1304">This whole idea of the male need for respect is new information to many women. In seminar sessions women sit in disbelief when I tell them that Scripture commands wives to give their husbands unconditional respect. I understand their confusion. They are so wired to love, and the culture has so radically enforced this whole idea of love-love-love, that they don’t really know the men they are married to. In fact, they often respond, “This is totally foreign to me.”</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1306"><i>To speak his language, remember: “the wife must respect her husband”(Ephesians 5:33 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1309">And that’s exactly the problem. When a wife does not speak “respect language,” after a while her husband isn’t interested in communicating. Who wants to keep talking to someone ywho doesn’t speak your language? So the husband goes quiet and walks away. Even though wives are told that husbands feel, “My wife doesn’t respect me,” their response is, “What’s that got to do with anything?” The answer, quite obviously, is: <i>everything</i>.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1314">It is high time for women to start discovering how their husbands really feel. One wife was shocked when she asked her husband, “Do you want me to tell you that I love you or that I respect you?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1316">Without hesitation he replied, “Respect.” She couldn’t believe her ears. She had never realized that though he needed her love, what he lacked was assurance of her respect. Learning this is hard on many a wife, and I am sorry that they have to feel everything from amazement to shame. No one is trying to shame wives. On the contrary, our Love and Respect message is designed to help wives see that their big, powerful husbands are really in need of something that wives can give—respect. When a husband receives unconditional respect from his wife, those fond feelings of affection will return, and he will start giving her the kind of love she has always hoped to receive.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1318">“SO THAT’S IT . . . I NEED RESPECT!”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1320">But not all men are conscious of their need for respect. Even significant leaders adept at assessing many different people in many different situations are not always in touch with why they react the way they do in their marriages. I had lunch with a man who ran for the United States Senate and, as I explained the Love and Respect Connection, he said, “Now that you’ve put it that way, that is exactly how I feel. That’s it. I want respect.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1322">A CEO of a large company attended our conference and, as he reflected on what he had heard, he realized he was reacting to his wife because he felt disrespected. He started voicing this to her, and though it created some tension for a while, it eventually resulted in a deeper understanding between them. In his words, “It helps me and her. When I humbly voice my feelings, we both know what’s going on, instead of me just being moody and withdrawing. Now as she seeks to understand me, her appeal to me to understand her need for love really makes sense. It feels fair.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1324">I have an acquaintance who has a PhD in educational psychology. As he went over the Crazy Cycle material with me, he said, “That is exactly what I feel when things get heated between my wife and me. For years it was something I was feeling down deep but wasn’t in tune with. I was reacting all right, but neither of us knew why.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1326">The common thread in what these three men said is that they couldn’t articulate their need for respect, but once it was pointed out, they understood. Early on they quite possibly may have thought to themselves at times, <i>I don’t deserve this disrespect.</i> But they soon suppressed those feelings. This is quite typical of today’s male because the culture has told him it isn’t right to express feelings of being disrespected, and if he dared to do so, his wife would not accept it because to her he would sound “arrogant.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1331">Another thing that may stop a man from voicing his need for respect is hearing from his wife, “You don’t deserve my respect.” With his vocabulary rejected as archaic and his attitude criticized as arrogant, it doesn’t take long for a male to file away his essential need for respect in a compartment labeled, “Do Not Bring Up.” And there it will stay—but if another woman admires him, then look out. As one wife shared after her husband strayed into an affair:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1334">I realized that my husband had cheated with this woman, not because of her looks or her personality, or because she was anything so great, but rather because she was his captiv[e] audience. She thought he hung the moon. Every remark he made to her was witty; everything he did was perfect. In her eyes, he was the most handsome, intelligent, funny man in the world. He needed an ego boost, and she was ready and willing to be that for him.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1336">ARE LOVE AND RESPECT THE SAME THING?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1338">There are many wives who tell me, “Respect and love are the same thing.” I respond, “No, they aren’t, and you know they aren’t. For instance, you respect your boss. You don’t love your boss.” I have been in counseling sessions with couples, and with her mate sitting there listening, the wife will readily say, “I love my husband but don’t feel any respect for him.” But when I turn this around and ask the wives how they would feel if they would hear their husbands say, “I respect you but don’t love you,” they are horrified. They exclaim, “I would be devastated.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1340">I asked one wife, “How long would it take you to get over that?” She quickly answered, “Forever.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1342">The typical wife would be up in arms if she heard, “I respect you but don’t love you.” That is taboo! She would view her husband as a very unloving human being. Yet this same wife feels she can readily say to him, “I love you but don’t respect you.” What she doesn’t understand is that her husband is equally devastated by her comment and it also takes him “forever” to “get over it.” The bottom line is that husbands and wives have needs that are truly equal. She needs unconditional love, and he needs unconditional respect.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1344">ALL THIS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS, RIGHT?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1346">Almost every time Sarah and I teach our seminar about the Love and Respect Connection, people tell us, “Why, of course; this is so obvious.” And then either the husband or the wife adds, “But why doesn’t my spouse get it?” Whether it’s a husband or a wife who “doesn’t get it,” the answer is the same: <i>we often don’t see the obvious</i>.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1351">A door-to-door salesman rang the bell and waited. A boy who looked about ten years old answered. He was smoking the biggest cigar the salesman had ever seen. After a few seconds of stunned silence on the salesman’s part, he finally asked, “Is your mother home?” The ten-year- old puffed a couple of times, blew smoke in the salesman’s face, and said, “What do <i>you</i> think?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1356">And that’s the point. If the salesman had been thinking at all, he would have known that Mother wasn’t at home. But for some reason we don’t always think, particularly when something is shocking or distracting. When a wife feels unloved, it can be such a shock to her heart that she is oblivious to her disrespectful reactions toward her husband, though any man watching could see it plainly. When a husband feels disrespected, it can provoke him so quickly he doesn’t see his unloving reaction, which would be obvious to any woman. Words of wisdom for all husbands and wives are these:</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1358">WE EASILY SEE WHAT IS DONE TO US BEFORE WE SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING TO OUR MATE.</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1360">When sorting out how to slow down the Crazy Cycle, it helps to remember that men are commanded to love because they don’t love naturally, and on the other side, women are commanded to respect because they don’t respect naturally. If the Love and Respect Connection is to make sense and work in a marriage, the wife, in particular, must conquer any feelings about her husband needing to earn her respect. I have counseled many wives who love to love, but they do not love to respect. When these women feel unloved, often they will try to improve the situation with even more love. That’s natural. But when these women feel unloved, it is hard for them to show respect. That’s unnatural. They act disrespectfully, but they don’t really want to. They are merely reacting to their built-in feelings. Not realizing how contemptuous she sounds, a wife might say, “He’s blowing this ‘respect thing’ out of proportion. He’s too sensitive. My scolding and sour look stay. That’s who I am at times. He needs to get over it! This is <i>his</i> problem.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1366">But, of course, it isn’t his problem; it’s <i>their</i> problem. How would this wife feel if her husband would say, “You’re blowing this love thing out of proportion. You’re just too sensitive. You’re always telling me I’m too harsh. You need to get over it”?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1371">Husbands, of course, also have their work cut out for them. Because they are feeling disrespected, they can lose sight of the heart of their wives. It is easy to lose fond feelings of affection in the face of what appears to be contempt. But is her goal to emasculate you? Not if she is good-willed. Even if she is unfairly nasty, this is no excuse for a man of honor to refuse to obey God’s command to love his wife. I believe the men who are reading this book are men of honor, and my appeal to them is this: <i>Love your wife. Always try to see what is in her deepest heart.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1375">If a husband has any honor and goodwill at all, he must step up to the plate and start figuring out this business of “being loving.” And he must conquer any fears he may have of her contempt. Her criticisms may not be contempt at all; they are simply her way of crying, “Please love me.” When a husband can decode that cry and respond to his wife with understanding and love, he will experience the joy of a fair and balanced approach to marriage, and those fond feelings of affection will return. I have talked to many men who say they want to try but are clueless as to how to go about it. Fortunately, there are plenty of clues, which I am always happy to share with any husband who is willing to listen, learn, and then change his approach to his wife. (See especially chapters 5 to 7, as well as chapters 8 to 14.)</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1377">MARRIED COUPLES ARE AT A CROSSROADS</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1379">Today married couples are at a crossroads. Will she appreciate her husband’s need for respect, or will she denounce his feelings? Will she discover that the best way to love a husband is by respecting him in ways that are meaningful to him? Or will she focus totally on what she feels is the key to a happy marriage—her womanly feelings—and dismiss his needs as antiquated or male arrogance?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1381">At the same time, will the husband appreciate his wife’s need for love or just continue to ignore her feelings? Will he discover the best way to love a wife is to look beyond her criticisms and complaints to see why she isn’t feeling loved? Or will he just cower before her apparent contempt and retreat to the shelter of his “stone wall”?</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1383"><i>In a marriage, the wise person give[s] thought to their ways”(Proverbs 14:8 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1386">Increasing numbers of couples who are at the crossroads are taking the right fork—the one labeled “Love and Respect.” One wife, a strong-minded career woman, wrote to tell us of how she and her husband were using the Love and Respect Connection concepts and that their Crazy Cycle is slowing down and has all but stopped. She wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1388">My husband was able to see that when he would withdraw (often because I was disrespectful), I would feel abandoned or unloved. So I would go after him with a vengeance that would make a warrior cower . . . which would disrespect him and hurt him deeply, causing him to withdraw even more severely—the whole “Crazy Cycle.” But he, for the first time, was willing to see that he had acted “unlovingly.” He was able to own some part of it. I think he was able to see that I was more delicate (even though I try really hard to sell my strength to everyone, including him) and that I do need him and want his support and strength. I asked him to forgive me for being so disrespectful. We have been talking and things have been gradually changing. Mutual understanding is setting in.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1390">At some points in this chapter I may sound as if I’m trying to hammer the wives on their lack of unconditional respect for their husbands. But I’m not trying to hammer wives—<i>I’m trying to help them</i>, because I know how pivotal the wife’s respect can be in slowing down the Crazy Cycle. Yes, many men are unloving clods to one degree or another, but they can change. In fact, many of them want to change, and the best way to get them to change is treating them with unconditional respect.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1395">In our conferences and counseling situations, we deal constantly with husbands and wives who quickly grasp the concept of the Crazy Cycle. They would like to get off—as soon as possible—but there are still a few reservations. They have been spinning for so long they wonder, <i>Can this stuff really work?</i> In chapter 5, we will start looking at answers to some typical questions and give practical advice for stopping the Crazy Cycle.</p>
