  <br />
  THE REAL REASON TO<br />
  LOVE AND RESPECT</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4451"><span class="dcap" id="d12e4452">P</span>erhaps the major problem that keeps so many couples somewhere between the Crazy Cycle and the Energizing Cycle is the fear that, even though they try to practice the Love and Respect Connection, it won’t work. Here are some sample remarks I receive by e-mail or in person in conferences: “My fear is that I’m going to move forward in good faith but my spouse will mistreat me” . . . “My wife will continue showing disrespect, riding a bigger broom than ever” . . . “My husband will continue to be unloving. He’ll re-enroll in the A-1 Jerks School and be first in his class.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4455">Of course, there is always the exception—someone who is afraid to try respect because it just might work! A wife wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4457">Your suggestion to apologize and let him know how much I respect him is great. I intend to do that. But my heart is afraid that he may react positively, and I don’t know if I am ready for more than what we have now: a mutual understanding for our roles as parents. It frightens me that I can do something so powerful and not be ready if he took a different kind of interest in me.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4459">Another question I often hear is, “Why show love and respect when it isn’t reciprocated?” One couple attended one of our conferences. She agreed to try respect, but according to her husband:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4461">. . . it faded away like a mist. She returned to her old self. She has not trusted me due to her relationship with her father. She has in the past been a vocal man-beater with her negative thoughts and comments about men, in general. I feel like an orphan in my own home. I feel like a husband with no wife. What I do experience of her presence is her critical, negative, hostile and judgmental attitude. . . . My emotions for my wife are being buried daily by her attitude towards me when she makes me feel less than a man. . . . I need to understand my wife and I need wisdom on how I can respond to her attacks.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4463">DON’T GIVE UP—TRUST GOD TO WORK</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4465">Letters like the one above are heartbreaking, but my advice is always the same: <i>Don’t give up because it doesn’t seem to be working</i>. Keep showing your spouse unconditional love or unconditional respect. Look for even the slightest improvements. A husband doesn’t bring flowers, but he does fix the leaky faucet. The wife still has a headache more than you like, but she has toned down the negativity. Remember the pink and blue lenses? We don’t readily see what is happening in our favor, nor do we see the impact we might be making on our spouse.</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4470"><i>“Do what is right without being frightened by any fear” (1 Peter 3:6).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4473">One graphic example is a letter from a wife who explained that her husband called from his night job to tell her he got an unexpected bonus check. “Praise God!” she said, and that made him angry. Then he started to complain about how hard he had to work. She tried to remind him they really needed the extra money and, “Why not be thankful?” As he continued to pour out his dissatisfaction with his lot in life, she (who was very much the lecturing type) decided not to give him another gentle lecture to stop feeling sorry for himself. Instead, she got respectfully quiet. As her silence continued, he said, “You better stop this quiet stuff. I mean it; it isn’t like you and it’s making me nervous. Something is wrong here. I don’t like it. I never said for you to be quiet. I said to listen to me without always saying something. So stop being quiet!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4475">When she wrote to say that her respectful quietness “apparently wasn’t working,” I replied that actually it was working big time. At this season of their marriage, her husband’s bad habits had to go, and he was already under conviction. The quietness probably caused him to hear himself, and he didn’t like what he was hearing. So he lashed out. But her quietness <i>was</i> working in a powerful way. I urged her to be patient and let the Holy Spirit convict her husband.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e4481"><i>Ultimately, we must depend on “the Helper,”the Holy Spirit, to “convict . . . concerning sin” (John 16:7–8).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4484">Months later she wrote back: “We are doing so well in our marriage. Our arguments have changed for the better.” Her husband’s spiritual life had significantly improved, and she gave credit to God but added, “I’d like to think it had a lot to do with my new attitude and silence, and respect in word and deed.” This wife is a perfect example of how it’s so easy to have doubts when things don’t look as if they are going well. It takes time—in many cases, months—before there is a shift. Don’t doubt the light from God’s Word in your dark times.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4486">Here’s another example of a wife who felt nothing was happening but later was amazed. She called her ex-husband and apologized because she hadn’t always respected his position in their home. (She is a Christian, and he is not.) There was silence, and then he responded, “Thank you.” That ended the conversation, but several days later he called back at midnight in tears, wondering why she had made her apology. She explained she had to ask forgiveness for not being what she should have been as a wife. Again, the conversation ended abruptly. Not much seemed to be happening. Another week passed, and again he called at midnight. He had been thinking of everything he had done, and he was sorry. He went on about all of his mistakes—“some of the few kind words he has ever said to me.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4488">In another situation, a wife moved out and bought another home. I coached the husband on how to behave toward her in more loving ways. This went on for some time, and he was seeing little progress. Then one day she said, “Are you wanting me to beg you to ask me to come back home?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4490">The above are just a few examples of what can happen. Don’t give up because weeks or months pass with no response. Don’t interpret delay as defeat. Don’t assume that what you are doing is unfruitful. Most often, love or respect is working on your spouse more than you realize. Something is transpiring in the soul of that person. Have confidence that God will work.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4492">WHEN IT SIMPLY DOESN’T WORK—WHAT THEN?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4494">What is your worst fear in marriage? As a husband, is not your worst fear that you put on love but your wife shows you contempt? In response to your good-willed attempt to be close, open, understanding, peacemaking, loyal, and esteeming, she remains disrespectful.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4496">As a wife, is not your worst fear that you put on respect but your husband is more unloving than ever? You have learned the “foreign language” of respect by appreciating his work efforts, his desire to protect and provide, to serve and lead, to give you his insights. You have also tried to give him shoulder-to-shoulder friendship and more sexual intimacy. Despite all this, he remains unloving. In good faith you moved first as the mature one, but your spouse did not change.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4498">As Jesus spoke of the trials and tribulations believers might have to go through for Him, He mentioned that “a man’s enemies will be the members of his household” (Matthew 10:36). For you, it may feel just this way. So should you simply say, “This Love and Respect thing doesn’t work”? When you love or respect unconditionally, you are following God and His will for you. Ultimately, your spouse and your marriage have nothing to do with it. You are simply demonstrating your obedience and trust in the face of an unlovable wife or a disrespecting husband. <i>Unconditional love and unconditional respect will be rewarded</i>. I call this the Rewarded Cycle. Jesus said, “For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?” (Matthew 5:46). Jesus could have had your troubled marriage in mind when He said that.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4503">I believe Paul also had your marriage in mind when he penned Ephesians 6:7–8: “Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free” (NIV). In the immediate context, Paul refers to how slaves can serve their masters, but notice that he ends the passage by saying it applies to free persons as well. In other words, this idea is for all believers. If you trace his thinking back a few verses, you find him mentioning this same principle concerning children and their parents (see Ephesians 6:1–4) and also husbands and wives (see Ephesians 5:22–33). Paul is saying that whatever we do as to the Lord we will receive back from the Lord. In marriage, everything you do counts, even if your spouse ignores you! This is what the Rewarded Cycle is all about (see page 265 for a visual of it):</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e4508"><i>“Don’t pay back unkind words with unkind words. Instead, pay them back with kind words”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e4512"><i>(1 Peter 3:9 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4515">HIS LOVE BLESSES REGARDLESS OF HER RESPECT;<br />
  HER RESPECT BLESSES REGARDLESS OF HIS LOVE.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4519">When I first began teaching this biblical truth as it pertains to marriage, I was unsure how people would receive it. Amazingly, many welcomed the Rewarded Cycle message with open arms. Those who feel hopeless suddenly catch the truth that what they do matters to God; <i>nothing is wasted.</i> This thought not only rejuvenates poor marriages, but it is helpful to good marriages. The key principle of the Rewarded Cycle is just as relevant for a good marriage as a poor one. Ultimately, all husbands and wives should be practicing Love and Respect principles first and foremost out of obedience toward Christ. If they do not, it is so easy to start being arrogantly proud about “our great marriage.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4524">All couples must take heed. Those who think they stand could easily fall. So many marriages seem to be getting along just great and then, <i>wham!</i> The wheels come off. If we take our eyes off Christ (or never put our eyes on Christ in the first place), we are building on sand, and when the storms come we can be swept away (see Matthew 7:24–27).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4529">Another benefit of the Rewarded Cycle for a good marriage is that you can understand why you are treating each other as you do and be more equipped to explain the Love and Respect Connection to other couples. And as other couples learn the Love and Respect Connection, the rewards increase exponentially. What are the rewards? We get some of them on earth, but we get an incredible reward in heaven.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4531">HEAVEN’S REWARD—THE ETERNAL “AHHH! ”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4533">I heard a godly man with cerebral palsy speak. He had a delightful wit: “God is preparing me for heaven. . . . I am in His oven, so to speak. I am being baked for an eternal purpose. I am not finished yet. When I die and stand before Him, He is going to say, ‘Well done.’” I laughed with delight as tears streamed down my cheeks.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4535">Jesus is preparing us to hear, “Well done.” He wants to say, “Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!” (Matthew 25:21 NIV).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4537">Have you ever thought about what it will mean to “share your master’s happiness”? It will be joy without measure. Think of your graduation day, wedding day, birthday, child’s birthday, summer vacation, promotion, retirement, good times with friends, affirmation from your parents, leading all family members to Christ, good health. What if every hour of every day you experienced the glory and joy of all these events at once in their fullest intensity? Realize that when you “share your master’s happiness,” the intensity will be a trillion times greater.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4539">How will you feel when you experience that endless first moment of joy? Remember when you wanted a bike for Christmas, but your parents wouldn’t say if you would get one or not? You were in limbo, and then Christmas morning arrived. There under the tree was your bright, shiny bike, and you gasped, “Ahhh!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4541">Or think of the woman who is surprised with a diamond ring. She gasps, “Ahhh!” While speaking to a group of Wall Street investors in New York, I asked if anyone there had had an “Ahhh!” experience. One man said, “Yeah, when I got my first unexpected bonus check of $100,000.” I swallowed hard then said, “Yes—that sort of gets at the idea!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4544">Do you realize that the greatest “Ahhh!” experience of your life is ahead? The Lord is closely watching and intends to reward you. “Each man’s praise will come to him from God” (1 Corinthians 4:5). To keep in mind what’s in store, memorize Ephesians 6:7–8: “Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does” (NIV). Envision the scene as believers ascend into heaven and stand before Christ. To one husband He says, “Well done. You’ve put on love toward your disrespectful wife. You are about to receive back every act of love you did toward her.” To a wife He says, “Well done. You’ve put on respect toward your unloving husband. I watched. You are about to be rewarded for every act of respect.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4546">Next, Jesus directs you to enter the place called Paradise (see Luke 23:43). He has brought you “safely to His heavenly kingdom” (2 Timothy 4:18). As you enter with Jesus, you experience a holy rush. “You stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy” (Jude 24). At that moment, unexpectedly, you behold a gift of such great value you gasp a holy “Ahhh!” What you behold is beyond anything you could imagine. Suddenly, instantly, you are enveloped by love and glory. You are literally “in glory” never to leave (Colossians 3:4).<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5566" id="d12e4548">1</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4551">To try to describe heaven is to describe the indescribable. Even Paul could only say that “momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison” (2 Corinthians 4:17; see also Romans 8:18).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4553">Let’s go back to Matthew 25:21: “You were faithful with a few things.” What would some of those “few things” be? Surely they include what Paul describes so clearly in Ephesians 5: “love [your] wife . . . respect [your] husband” (see v. 33). When you make a decision to love or respect your spouse, the dividends are without end. Jesus is offering you a bargain. Do a few things on earth in this life and get many things forever in heaven.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4555">WHAT MATTERS TO GOD, MATTERS!</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4557">To the world it may make no sense for a wife to put on respect toward a husband who is harsh and unloving. It makes no sense for a husband to put on love toward a contemptuous, disrespectful woman. But it makes sense to God. These seemingly fruitless efforts matter to God because this is the kind of service He rewards. What is wisdom to God is foolishness to the world (see 1 Corinthians 3:19).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4559">One way I like to picture this is that there is a <i>cha-ching!</i> effect in heaven when believers do things the world might call stupid. It’s as though a billion angels are holding a gigantic handle. Each time you do something loving or respectful toward your spouse, the angels pull down on that handle. A secret treasure dumps into a colossal golden bowl and <i>cha-ching!</i> The lead angel exclaims, “He did it again! He put on love toward that disdainful woman!” . . . “She did it again! She put on respect toward that pathetic man! Okay, everyone, hit it again! <i>Cha-ching!”</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4569">Admittedly, this imagery sounds a little fanciful, but it may not be that far off. The prayers of the saints are collected in “golden bowls” (Revelation 5:8). The Lord is keeping track somehow. As Paul says, “Whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord” (Ephesians 6:8). God’s divine system is in place, and all is accounted for. The books will be opened and all will be judged according to their deeds (see Revelation 20:12).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4571">Am I suggesting in any way that we are supposed to earn our salvation? Obviously not. Paul clearly says we are saved by grace through faith—“it is the gift of God; not as a result of works” (Ephesians 2:8–9). But look at Ephesians 2:10. We are to do the good works that God has already planned for us. Why? Not to appease the Lord or somehow pay “just a little bit” for our salvation, but simply to please Him. And when we please Him, He rewards us.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4573">In 1 Corinthians 3:11–15, Paul clearly distinguishes salvation from rewards. Each believer should build with care on the only real foundation—Jesus Christ. “If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man’s work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames” (vv. 12–15 NIV).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4575">Some of us may be tempted to say, “I’m not concerned about rewards—I just want to follow the Lord and reach heaven.” But think for a moment. If Christ says He intends to reward you, then who are you to declare, “I don’t care about that”? There is a certain false humility in saying, “Oh, rewards are so unimportant.” Rewards are important because Jesus reveals them as important. I do not believe it is wise to take issue with the Son of God.</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4578"><i>Some say rewards are unimportant, but Jesus says, “I am coming soon! I bring my rewards with me.I will reward each person for what he has done”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e4581"><i>(Revelation 22:12 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4584">Yes, the rewards are waiting. <i>Nothing we do is wasted</i>. The Lord is watching with intense interest. A husband who loves his wife as Christ loved the church, and the wife who respects her husband “as to the Lord,” will be rewarded throughout eternity (see Ephesians 5:22–33).</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4589">IT’S ABOUT YOU AND JESUS CHRIST</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4591">After more than a quarter of a century of counseling married couples and conducting Love and Respect Conferences, I have concluded that we don’t have a “marriage crisis” in the Christian community; we have a crisis of faith. The point is that we all have to come to grips with one question: “Do I or do I not believe what Jesus Himself said?” The whole point is that you really can’t do Love and Respect unless you do it unto Jesus Christ. And if you doubt the reality of Christ, if He is not truly Lord of your life, it won’t work.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4593">Many husbands and wives need to come to the point where they say, “Lord, I do believe; help my unbelief. I want to follow You, and I want to do this as unto You” (see Mark 9:24; Ephesians 6:7–8). One wife who made this discovery wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4595">I used to become very defensive and wounded by men. Now I have learned that my sufficiency is in Christ, my acceptance, my security, my significance comes through Christ. It’s not about me, it’s all about Him. I have nothing to prove to anyone. . . . I can relax and allow the Holy Spirit to work in me and through me.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4597">Yes, there will be times when you will fail, but Proverbs 24:16 says, “A righteous man falls seven times, and rises again.” Nobody can love perfectly and no one can respect perfectly. However, when we do this as unto Christ, we may fall but we can get up. The difference between successful couples and unsuccessful couples is that the successful ones keep getting up and keep dealing with the issues. Unsuccessful couples want it easy. They want it now. They want their needs to be met. They don’t want conflict; they just want everything to be “happy.” This approach is the epitome of immaturity.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4599">The mature husband admits, “I blew it big time. I was wrong. I was unloving again. I’ve got issues I must deal with.” The mature wife says, “You know, I just keep dishonoring you and not respecting you. I keep thinking it’s all about love. I can’t even remember that simple word <i>respect</i>.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4604">I actually had one woman say, “What’s that word again?” I said, “It’s <i>respect</i>.” She said, “Oh, yeah, that’s it.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4609">Fortunately, there are many more wives who learn and apply the word <i>respect.</i> One wife discovered her unsaved husband was having an affair, and her respect for him plummeted. Later he came to Christ, they reconciled, and he is now trying to grow into the role of spiritual leader in the home while she tries to be the best wife possible. They have a long way to go, but they are making progress. She writes:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4615">It is easier for me to respect my husband out of obedience to God than necessarily because he is behaving respectfully. Thank you for helping me see how fragile a male ego can be. I never realized how much his own self-worth as a husband and a man hinges on a wife’s respect. I have been keeping your words in mind if and when an argument would brew. Several times, by making a concerted effort to speak respectfully, rather than just going with my emotions, I have been able to ward off hurt feelings and harsh words between us.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4617">Another wife who had suffered physical and verbal abuse from her husband (which I absolutely condemn as wicked and urge a wife to seek protection and help for) and had gone back to him after he repented, realized she had not completely forgiven him and certainly wasn’t showing him respect. After coming across our materials, she began showing him respect, mostly by remaining quiet and dignified instead of arguing. Their relationship improved considerably, and she says:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4619">My heart’s desire is to win my husband to the Lord through my respectful behavior. I must admit I have to “mull over” some of your teaching, but it IS biblically based, and the Holy Spirit keeps revealing my rebellion, contempt, disobedience, etc. I keep asking the Lord for strength to implement your suggestions, and He is so faithful!</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4621">“LORD, WHEN DID I FEED YOU? ”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e4623">The Rewarded Cycle will deepen your love and reverence for Christ as you render love and respect to your spouse as unto Him. In the parable of the last judgment (see Matthew 25:31–46), the righteous ask, “Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink? And when did we see You a stranger, and invite You in, or naked, and clothe You? When did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?” (v. 37–39). And the king answers the righteous and says, “Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me” (v. 40).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4625">There is a basic principle we can take from this parable: whatever I do for my spouse, I do it to Christ as well. A husband’s unconditional love for his wife reveals his love for Christ. The husband who loves God should love his wife also. If you are not loving your wife, then you must ask yourself, “Am I really loving Jesus Christ?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4627">A wife’s unconditional respect for her husband reveals her reverence for Christ (see Ephesians 5:21–22; 6:6–7). The wife who respects God should respect her husband. If you are not respecting your husband, then you must ask yourself, “Am I really loving Jesus Christ?” For husband or wife, the conclusion is the same:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e4629"><i>“ ‘In the resurrection, when they rise again, which one’s wife will she be? For all seven had married her.’ Jesus said to them, ‘Is this not the reason you are mistaken, that you do not understand the Scriptures, or the power of God? For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven’ ”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e4632"><i>(Mark 12:23-25).</i></p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e4635">IN THE ULTIMATE SENSE, YOUR MARRIAGE HAS NOTHING<br />
  TO DO WITH YOUR SPOUSE.<br />
  IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP<br />
  TO JESUS CHRIST.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4643">Yes, you will fail to perfectly love or respect, but that doesn’t mean that you don’t love Christ. In fact, your love for Christ is what gets you started again. You repent and confess, realizing you are not expecting your spouse to meet all your needs. But ultimately, whatever you do toward your spouse by way of love or respect is not done to motivate your spouse to get off the Crazy Cycle, nor is it to motivate your spouse to meet your needs. Ultimately, you practice love or respect because beyond your spouse you see Jesus Christ and you envision a moment when you will be standing before Him at the final judgment, realizing that your marriage was really a tool and a test to deepen and demonstrate your love and your reverence for your Lord.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4646">Every time you do reach out with love or respect, heaven is watching. Those billion angels yank that big lever and, <i>Cha-ching! Cha-ching!</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4650">I was talking to a friend of mine who is vice president of a large TV network. When he heard this teaching about the Rewarded Cycle, he said, “Whoa, it’s not about my spouse, is it? It’s about me and Jesus Christ. I have never heard this.” My friend is a believer, but he never had clearly understood it’s not about him and his spouse. It’s about him and his Lord.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e4652"><i>“Watch out that you don’t lose what you have worked for. Make sure that you get your complete reward”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e4655"><i>(2 John 1:8 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e4658">But there is even more to the Rewarded Cycle. There is this whole area called “maturity”—having true inner freedom in Christ and the overflow that comes out of that as you are an example to your children and others around you, especially your spouse. We will look at these rewards in the next—and final—chapter.</p>
