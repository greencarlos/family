  <p class="h1" id="d12e5596">Welcome to the Family!</p>

  <p class="txc" id="d12e5598">Whether you received this book as a gift, borrowed it, or purchased it yourself, we’re glad you read it. It’s just one of the many helpful, insightful, and encouraging resources produced by Focus on the Family.</p>

  <p class="txc" id="d12e5600">In fact, that’s what Focus on the Family is all about—providing inspiration, information, and biblically based advice to people in all stages of life.</p>

  <p class="txc" id="d12e5602">It began in 1977 with the vision of one man, Dr. James Dobson, a licensed psychologist and author of 18 best-selling books on marriage, parenting, and family. Alarmed by the societal, political, and economic pressures that were threatening the existence of the American family, Dr. Dobson founded Focus on the Family with one employee and a once-a-week radio broadcast aired on only 36 stations.</p>

  <p class="txc" id="d12e5604">Now an international organization, the ministry is dedicated to preserving Judeo-Christian values and strengthening and encouraging families through the life-changing message of Jesus Christ. Focus ministries reach families worldwide through 10 separate radio broadcasts, two television news features, 13 publications, 18 Web sites, and a steady series of books and award-winning films and videos for people of all ages and interests.</p>
