My biblical theology of Ephesians 5:33 is simple: a husband is commanded to love his wife unconditionally, and a wife is to respect her husband unconditionally. This is what the text says—period. The Love and Respect Connection (my theory) is inferred from verse 33. So far, every couple I work with seems to experience the Crazy Cycle to one degree or the other. Ephesians 5:33 reveals that a wife needs love and a husband needs respect, and when those needs are unmet each spouse reacts at some level. My theory says that the wife has a tendency to react in ways that feel disrespectful to the husband (thus, the command to her to respect). And the husband has a tendency to react in ways that feel unloving to the wife (thus, the command to him to love).</p>

In Ephesians 5:33, Paul uses the Greek word for love (<i>agape</i>) in the present active imperative, and the word for respect (<i>phobetai</i>) in this usage becomes a practical imperative. Both usages in this text are meant as a command. This is why the NIV uses the word “must” for both these phrases. (A. T. Robertson, ed., <i>A Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of Historical Research,</i> 4th ed. [New York: Hodder, 1923], 994.)</p>

When I refer to the feminist movement, I am referencing the more radical elements. Many positive benefits for women have come out of feminism. However, what profoundly disturbs me is that a substantial segment of the feminist movement has promoted a negative, contemptuous attitude toward men simply because they are men. As a follower of Christ, I see both men and women created in God’s image. I am to love and respect God’s creation. Though men and women are sinful and in need of Christ, the Lord Himself yearns for every soul to experience His love and glory (i.e., highest respect!). To have a demeaning attitude toward males simply because they are males is to look down on sons, brothers, uncles, grandfathers, fathers, husbands, and male friends in a way that God Himself does not.</p>

I appreciate the significant contribution women are making to the military, but my observation is that the military is a particularly natural place for the male, especially in combat. In fact, a broad policy in the military, no matter what the branch of service, is not to use women in combat situations. For policy statements, see U.S. Marines—http://www.Marines.com/officer_programs/FAQ.asp?format=/ and Center for Military Readiness—http://www.cmrlink.org/WomenInCombat and Center for Military Readiness—http://www.cmrlink.org/WomenInCombat .asp?docID=154. My point is that, by the very nature of who they are, men are better equipped to serve, fight, and die if need be; and this same drive transfers to the home and the family, where the man fills the role of protector.</p>

For an in-depth discussion of the difference between the compartmentalization of men and the integration of women, see Stephen B. Clark, <i>Man and Woman in Christ</i> (Ann Arbor: Servant Books, 1980). In his thorough study of the differences between men and women, Clark references two specialists in the trait-patterns of male and female: Dietrich von Hildebrand, <i>Man and Woman</i> (Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1965), and Edith Stein, <i>The Writings of Edith Stein</i> (London: Peter Owen, 1956). Clark writes: “Both von Hildebrand and Stein say that men and women differ in the way their minds, emotions, and bodies function together. A woman’s emotions, intellect, and body form a more integrated unity than those of a man. She confronts decisions, activities, and relationships as an entire person—a blend of emotions, intellect, and body. On the other hand, a man’s emotions, intellect, and body are more differentiated. He more easily compartmentalizes elements of his personality, treating them as aspects of his identity which he can at times temporarily ignore.”</p>

In Matthew 19:1–6, Jesus is answering the Pharisees’ query, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?” (see v. 3). Instead of taking either of the rabbinical positions—one liberal, one more conservative—Jesus focused on Genesis 2:23–24 and the concept of “one flesh.” Marriage is to be “the deepest physical and spiritual unity.” See Charles E. Ryrie, <i>The Ryrie Study Bible</i> (Chicago: Moody, 1976), 1478.</p>

In 1 Corinthians 7:25–38, Paul gives the Corinthians “wisdom” that he admits is not a direct command from the Lord Jesus in the Gospels. Because he felt that time for winning people to Christ was short, he preferred that Christians not be married, so they could concentrate on doing the Lord’s work. Paul isn’t putting down marriage. He is simply stating a fact about what happens when good-willed men and women marry: they will be concerned about how to please one another. Paul realizes that married people can still serve the Lord.</p>

A loving wife is called upon to overlook certain failures and mistakes by her husband “because love covers a multitude of sins” (1 Peter 4:8). And a husband overlooks words or actions by his wife that may seem disrespectful because “a prudent man overlooks an insult” (Proverbs 12:16 NIV).</p>

Feminists do, in fact, severely differ with several of Paul’s observations in 1 Corinthians 11:3–16. As Paul discusses a problem in the church at Corinth, he advises women to appear in worship services with their heads covered, something that some of them apparently were not doing as art of their “traditions” (11:2). He states: “For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man” (1 Corinthians 11:7). From the feminist point of view, this verse seems to be feeding the male ego at the expense of a woman’s dignity. From the Love and Respect point of view, however, men need to feel honored and respected in the same way women need to feel loved. Consider this statement: “Women were created to be loved by men in the same way Christ loved the church; therefore, men are created to bring love to women.” Few women would object to this, but it is a little harder to accept what Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians 11:7. In giving advice on a protocol problem in the church at Corinth, Paul has uncovered a profound truth. A man needs to feel honored for who he is—the image and glory of God—because God made him that way. This is not chauvinist egotism. It is a fundamental need built into the male by the Creator. Yes, there are chauvinists among men just as there are prima donnas among women, but these exceptions should not be the rule. I believe our culture, which is heavily influenced by feminism, has missed the beauty of God’s design.</p>

In his book <i>The Essential Difference: The Truth about the Male and Female Brain,</i> Simon Baron-Cohen reported his findings after twenty years of research on gender differences in which he concluded that the female brain is predominantly hard-wired for showing empathy while the male brain is hard-wired for understanding and building systems. Baron-Cohen developed his theories by observing infants in the crib and noting the kind of stimuli they responded to. Girl babies responded better to faces above them while boy babies responded to mobiles. For a review of BaronCohen’s book, see Carolyn See, “His and Hers,”<i>Washington Post</i>, 5 October 2003.</p>

Bales hold that the basic model of the family consists of two adult partners (husband and wife) living together with their children. Roles tend to revolve around internal tasks for the wife and external tasks for the husband. The authors describe these as the expressive versus instrumental orientations—see Talcott Parson and Robert F. Bales, <i>Family, Socialization and Interaction Process</i> (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1955). Though various voices differ with this model, it still doesn’t go away! I hold to this as reflecting the basic nature and interests of men and women. Generally, women will be focused on relationships in the family, expressing the wonders of love. Though a career for the woman is important in our present cul- ture, we still find career being an <i>option</i> for women if they want children. A career is a freedom of choice for them, whereas a man feels <i>compelled</i> to work outside the home in the field.</p>

Bloesch, <i>Is the Bible Sexist?</i> (Westchester, Ill.: Crossway, 1982), 36–37). Bloesch points out that the Bible “nowhere sanctions the abuse and exploitation of women. Instead, it emphasizes the need for their care and protection. Some feminists call this ‘condescension,’ but deference to woman as woman belongs to the very nature of masculinity, just as a certain dependency on the male is the very essence of femininity.”</p>

He is generally credited with writing many parts of the book of Proverbs, including chapters 1–9. Unfortunately, Solomon wound up with seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, most of whom were idol-worshiping women from outside of Israel who turned his heart away from God (see 1 Kings 11:1–8). Solomon could not follow his own advice about sex, but that does not preclude the wisdom of what God inspired him to write.</p>

In this section, 1 Peter 2:13–3:7, Peter has a clear outline, which he sums up in 3:8. The outline is discovered by noticing the repetition of the phrase, place yourselves under authority (1 Peter 2:13; 2:18; 3:1). Notice another repetition when he addresses wives and husbands. He uses the phrase “in the same way” (1 Peter 3:1, 7). We might say the four main points of the outline are: citizens, slaves, wives, and husbands. Each of these groups is to submit. In Peter’s mind, the greatest evidence of submission is Love and Respect! “Live like free people. . . . Show proper respect to everyone. Love the community of believers. Have respect for God. Honor the king” (1 Peter 2:16–17 NIRV). In other words, a wife who is inwardly free submits by respecting her husband, which Peter clearly states (3:2). By implication, a husband who is inwardly free submits by loving his wife—that is, he lives with her in an understanding way and honors her as an equal.</p>
