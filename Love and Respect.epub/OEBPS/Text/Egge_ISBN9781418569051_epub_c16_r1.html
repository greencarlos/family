  <br />
  SHE WORRIES ABOUT BEING A<br />
  HYPOCRITE; HE COMPLAINS,<br />
  “I GET NO RESPECT! ”</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1605"><span class="dcap" id="d12e1606">S</span>he had been married for thirty-eight years, and it hadn’t been easy. Her husband had served in reconnaissance with the U.S. Marines in Vietnam and had returned with post-traumatic stress disorder. For years following the war he dealt with his memories by being an overachiever, and he became very successful. Although a Christian, he eventually got into an affair and became an alcoholic, ruining his health.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1609">“He is unable to work,” her letter continued. “He is away from the Lord. For years I have been ‘stuck’ on the command for wives to respect their husbands. If the Lord said it, I believe it’s true, but I did not want to be a hypocrite. . . .”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1611">Many wives find themselves in similar situations, and they often tell me that, while they want to be respectful and obedient to the Lord, they don’t want to be hypocritical, going through motions that don’t mean anything. Gently but firmly I respond that I’m not asking wives to be hypocrites by respecting their husbands even if they don’t “feel respectful.” This really isn’t about feelings. It’s about how wives can help control the Crazy Cycle by doing what the Scriptures teach. Peter calls wives to respectful and chaste behavior in order to win husbands who are being disobedient to God’s Word (see 1 Peter 3:1–2). Obviously, wives can go on “winning the battles” by attacking, criticizing, or lecturing husbands who are drinking, straying, or whatever their problems may be, but they will eventually lose the war.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1613">When a man is harsh, uncaring, or unaware, the wife can say he is unloving and needs to change; that he needs to correct himself—and I agree completely. Obviously, the man needs to understand her womanliness and need for love. If her spirit deflates and she becomes grieved, he is called to be a man of honor and serve her needs. But here is the rub: such a man may be called, but he won’t necessarily answer. At this point a wife faces two basic choices. She can try to make personal adjustments and treat her husband respectfully according to what Scripture says, or she can continue with a sour look and a negative, disrespectful attitude. She can continue to contend, “If he feels disrespected, that’s his problem. How can I feel respect for him when he is so unaware of me and my feelings? That would be hypocritical.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1615">I understand why a wife could feel hypocritical about respecting a man who has been treating her badly. But to continue with disrespect only means shooting herself in both feet. Few wives have real malice in their hearts, but their negative emotions can get the better of them. The deepest yearning of their hearts—for love—is clouded by negativity. Not only do husbands feel they can never fulfill a wife’s expectation of love, but now they feel disrespected for who they are.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1617">The typical man cannot put a voice to this, but he feels responsible to meet his wife’s need for love and somehow try to meet his own need for respect. This kind of man shuts down in the face of it all. It is simply too overwhelming. Does the disrespected husband let his wife know how he feels? No. As a rule, a man doesn’t complain and he doesn’t cry. He simply grits his teeth and compartmentalizes his feelings. He may be dying inside, but he won’t tell his wife for fear she’ll say, “You don’t deserve my respect.” So he grows silent. He withdraws, possibly walks away in anger. She has won another battle but feels even more unloved.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1619">She feels caught. She doesn’t feel any love coming from him, so showing respect for him seems phony. Besides, if she shows respect, she feels he will “get his way.” I asked one woman, “Are you afraid that your respectful manner will lessen your chances of motivating your husband to change?” Here is her response:</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1621"><i>We are called to follow Jesus, who “kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously”(1 Peter 2:23).</i></p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1624">After pondering that, I have concluded that this is where the rubber hits the road. If I trust my feelings (or previous experiences where contempt has seemed effective), I will be afraid to do it differently. If I step out in faith, claiming God’s Word as the basis for my action, then I am trusting God to bring to pass what He said He would do. I can’t go wrong with that! I’ve determined that is the path I am going to take no matter how unfamiliar it seems.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1626">Amen! This wife “gets it”! Obeying God’s Word does not make a wife a powerless hypocrite. Actually, it makes her a woman who loves and reverences God.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1629">This can happen even in the most difficult situations. The lady whose letter opened this chapter put aside her fears of being a hypocrite and tried to be respectful to her husband. Her letter continues:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1631">I am asking the Lord to show me ways to show [my husband] genuine respect. I have definitely seen a difference in his attitude toward me. I believe that more good things will come as I continue to show him unconditional respect, and after all, the Lord is responsible for the outcome. I have only to be obedient to Him, and He will handle what concerns me.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1633">Exactly. We are not called to change everything or everyone. We are only called to be obedient, and God will handle it from there. I would never claim that this is simple and effortless. It takes tremendous faith, courage, and fortitude. But it can pay off in incredible ways, as one wife who read our Love and Respect materials learned. She writes:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1635">It’s amazing what can happen when a man feels respected. I knew that I needed to show unconditional respect for my husband whether I felt like it or not. I started going through the actions, even though the feelings weren’t there. After a while, the feelings started to follow, especially now! My husband has been serving just as you said. This last weekend we had our neighbors over for dinner [and] my husband offered to cook the dinner. He also washed my car this weekend (he has never done that before) and out of his Christmas bonus, he gave me $500 to spend, no questions asked. He’s also cleaned the kitchen and has done the dishes twice now. I’ve been sending him e-mails at work about once a week just to let him know I’m so thankful that, because of him and his hard work, I can be a stay-at-home mom to our two children. I’ve made sure the house is clean and dinner is done when he gets home from work. I’ve also made sure that I’m not wearing sweats and looking “ratty” when he comes home. I’m more pleasant and excited.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1637">Trusting and obeying God’s Word because we love and reverence God never, ever makes us a hypocrite! When the alarm goes off in the morning, we get up, even when we don’t feel like getting up. Because we do what we don’t feel like doing, does that make us hypocrites? No, it is a sign we are responsible people. Showing respectful behavior when we don’t “feel respectful” is evidence of maturity, not hypocrisy.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1639"><i>Trust God to handle it.“The eyes of the Lord are on” those who do right, “and his ears are attentive to their prayer”(1 Peter 3:12 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1642">REFUSE TO PLAY RODNEY DANGERFIELD—DON’T STONEWALL!</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1644">To the husband who may sense that his wife thinks being respectful to him is hypocritical, my advice is this: do not give up! And do not go into your well-worn Rodney Dangerfield mantra: “I just don’t get no respect!” Instead, be a man of honor and move toward your wife even if you are receiving what feels like verbal deathblows. Call on that same sense of male honor that makes men willing to take a hit for their buddies in combat. Be willing to take a hit from your wife. You won’t die (although at times death may seem preferable).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1646">You can be the mature one who makes the first move toward your wife, even though she has seriously wronged you. As you engage her, you can take the verbal deathblows to stop the craziness. Yes, it will be hard and even humiliating, but you can win the heart of your wife! Scripture says, “A fool’s anger is known at once, but a prudent man conceals dishonor” (Proverbs 12:16). Suppose your wife is being horribly disrespectful. There is no question that you have the “right” to be offended. But as a man of wisdom <i>you choose to conceal the dishonor</i>. You hear God calling you to take a different approach, and you <i>can</i> do it. If you keep saying that you can’t, then you will persuade yourself this is impossible. You must distinguish between “I can’t” and “I won’t.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1654">I USED TO SAY, “I’LL SHOW HER!”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1656">In my own marriage, there was a season when it was important to me to get in tune to why I reacted to Sarah. As this notion of unconditional respect surfaced in my soul, I still felt embarrassed to say directly to her, “I feel disrespected.” That appeared to me to be self-centered and, admittedly, I was uncertain of Sarah’s reply. Would she snap, “Well, you don’t deserve respect”? I don’t recall her ever saying that, but I distinctly recall thinking it would be dangerous to express feelings of being disrespected. It was much easier for me to send my message indirectly in code—by getting angry or going silent. In my anger, I was thinking, <i>She can’t treat me this way. I’ll show her!</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1661"><i>When offended, husbands should “act like men, be strong”(1 Corinthians 16:13).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1664">So I withdrew. Strangely, that never seemed to work. I didn’t realize it at the time, but because I wanted respect I was trying to motivate her to be respectful by being unloving. (Sort of like trying to urge her to be more watchful by poking her in the eye with a sharp stick.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1666">There came a time, however, when I knew I had to be clearer. I had to grow up and be more mature. But how could I respond to Sarah so she could get my real message? As a man of honor, I needed to introduce some kind of change. The phrase I came up with was: “Honey, that felt disrespectful. Did I just now come across as unloving?” (For more ideas on what to say or not say, see appendix A, p. 305.)</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1668">I did not say, “Sarah, you are a disrespectful black widow spider using your venom to devour me!” Personal attacks never, ever work with anybody. The phrase, “That felt disrespectful,” removed the personal attack. I was not saying she was a disrespectful person. I was only describing what I felt. My new approach allowed me to express my feelings without claiming Sarah was wrong and I was right. I could say to Sarah, “I’m not saying I am right for feeling this way, nor am I saying you caused me to feel this way. I am only saying that I feel this way.” I was not necessarily confessing these feelings were sinful, nor was I saying Sarah was an angel.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1670">The line, “Honey, that felt disrespectful,” has many possible applications. Sometimes I needed to grow up and not personalize things Sarah did or said as “disrespect.” On other occasions, Sarah needed to be a little more positive about the man she married.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1672">But the icing on the cake is when I would add, “Did I just come across as unloving?” This gave Sarah the benefit of the doubt, and often she returned the favor. Too many times in the past I had put her on the defensive. Countless times, Sarah had said in defeat, “It’s always me. I’m always to blame. You are always right. You never do wrong.”</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1674"><i>“The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds persuasiveness to his lips” (Proverbs 16:23).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1677">My new approach gave Sarah a break. I didn’t say I was always right and could never do wrong. I owned up to my part of the blame, and for her this was a breath of fresh air! Sarah quickly decided she loved hearing me say, “Honey, that felt disrespectful. Did I just now come across as unloving?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1679">Granted, these two sentences can feel a bit awkward the first time or two you use them. They are forcing you to be transparent and even to lead with your chin in some respects. But if a couple wishes to address the deepest issues when conflicts arise, this gets to it very quickly. If a couple wants to get off the Crazy Cycle, this speeds up the process. It certainly has for us.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1681">True, there is a risk that Sarah might say, “Well, yes, I felt unloved because you are unloving and you don’t deserve respect.” For most couples that never happens. The power of these simple Love and Respect sentences is that both spouses feel affirmed at the level of deepest need. What usually happens is this: Sarah says, “Yes, I felt unloved. I am sorry for coming across so disrespectfully. Will you forgive me?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1683">I reply, “Yes. Will you forgive me for coming across as unloving?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1686">She answers, “Of course.” And it’s over. Just that quickly.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1688">IT WORKS—EVEN ON OUR BAD DAYS</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1690">Having said that, on any given day Sarah and I can get nasty with each other. We can get stubborn and pout. We can even raise our voices! I can give an evil glare. I can shut down, refusing to talk. Sarah can stomp out of the room. We step on each other’s air hose—sometimes with gusto!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1692">But no matter what happens, we both have a firm commitment that we will get to our Love and Respect sentences before we go to bed. If I’m feeling disrespected, I tell her so and then ask if I’ve been unloving. If she’s feeling unloved, she tells me so and asks if she’s been disrespectful. The biblical teaching is: “Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger” (Ephesians 4:26). This works, and it works well.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1694"><i>It is always wise for a husband to be “humble in spirit” (1 Peter 3:8).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1697">The struggle is in humbling yourself, authentically making these two brief statements, and then letting them lead to an honest discussion. If you don’t want to see positive change in your marriage, you won’t go there. But for me as a man, talking about feeling disrespected is in keeping with who I am. The Love and Respect message provides me an incentive to “go there.” And when I say to Sarah, “Did I come across as unloving?” she is invigorated to engage me in response. It works.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1699">IF I CAN DO IT, SO CAN YOU</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1701">As mature men, we need to take leadership and put this out on the table. We must acknowledge our feelings—we need to feel respected. However, as we do this we must acknowledge our wife’s feelings—she needs to feel loved! This is a fair and balanced approach that allows the two of you to unpack what really happened. Avoiding the whole thing time and again (or blowing up each time) remedies nothing. A spouse wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1703">We were able to talk about “sticky” situations without the discussion ending in a heated argument. THAT was the phenomenal part! And we both were laying it on the line as far as admitting to one another, “Yes! That is how I’ve felt all these years!” . . . So we’ve begun this new level of learning together. I’m very excited. I already see my marriage improving dramatically. It was like a weight had been lifted from our very countenances when we conversed and came to all the realizations we had!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1705">Admittedly, this takes guts. One man told me:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1707">I see my wife’s anger and hate for me, and at times I just don’t know how to deal with this. . . . I know that she is not asking for a lot, but I have never really been good at communicating with her and don’t know how to start and then continue doing it. I am tired of fighting with her, and many times I avoid communicating so that it does not escalate into an argument. She perceives my lack of communication as not caring or being dishonest with her. I just don’t know why it comes so hard for me to do.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1710">Another husband put it this way:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1712">Our disagreements are centered on her emotional outbursts and my lack of emotion. I love my wife and consider myself emotional about her. However, I try not to allow emotion to control me. I believe love is expressed with actions and not with reactions. . . . I do love the emotion my wife has, and I know God has us together to love and respect each other as we seek to glorify Him, but I struggle when my wife justifies her behavior as an uncontrollable emotional reaction. I’m not looking for something to condemn her with; instead, I would like to handle this.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1714">To both these husbands I say, “Gentlemen, it is true you are not designed by God to enjoy contempt, but He does call you to take the hit.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1716">In his extensive research on marriages, Dr. John Gottman concluded that it was very effective when a husband could embrace his wife’s anger. He advised men <i>not</i> to avoid conflict if they want to make their marriages work<b><i>.</i></b> To sidestep the problem, to leave the conflict unresolved, would only upset the wife more. The husband must always remember that the wife must talk about what’s eating her. As she vents her feelings, she believes she is keeping the marriage healthy and helping the relationship work more smoothly. She is not trying to attack her husband personally. “If you stay with her through this discomfort, and listen to her criticisms,” says Gottman, “she will calm down. If you stonewall, she’ll be edgy and may escalate the conflict.”<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5368" id="d12e1725">1</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1728">My suggestion to fellow husbands is: instead of running from your wife, will you move toward her or let her move toward you, firing her venomous little darts as she comes? If you’re ready to take the hit, you can stop the craziness. After she vents, you can lovingly say, “Honey, I love you. I don’t want this. When you talk this way, I know you’re feeling unloved. Let’s work on this. I want to come across more lovingly, and I hope you would like to come across more respectfully.” (For more ideas, see appendices A, B, and C.)</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1730">THE HUSBAND WHO NEVER STOPPED LOVING</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1732">One of the most striking examples of a husband who never stopped engaging his wife, even as she tried to deal their marriage a deathblow, came to me in an e-mail written by the wife after she and her husband had traveled six hundred miles to attend one of our conferences. When they arrived at the conference, their marriage was held together by a tattered thread. They both agreed it was the best conference they had ever attended, but they went back home with the wife still feeling very negative about the marriage. She was still tired of her life and her husband. But her husband wouldn’t give up, and the rest of her e-mail tells the story:</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1734"><i>“Suppose you love those who love you. Should anyone praise you for that? Even ‘sinners’ love those who love them”(Luke 6:32 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1737">We are still together today because, for the past few months, he has done exactly what you talked about at your conference concerning “His Love Regardless of Her Respect.” He loved me when I was not lovable at all and held on to our marriage and his family, when there was absolutely NOTHING to hold on to.</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e1739">This past October I asked him to please leave the house. I wanted to be alone, I wanted space, and I just felt like I didn’t love him anymore. Reluctantly, he left for a couple of weeks. . . . I knew that my life and the life of the girls would drastically change with a divorce. I thought about the shared visitation and how we would also have to sell our home, which we recently finished remodeling, but I didn’t care, I just wanted out! [Meanwhile] he prayed, studied marriage books and tapes, and made a decision to love me no matter what.</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e1741">The girls were really starting to miss him not being around, so we decided he would return home “until further notice.” Well, he would hold my hand every night and pray for me and for our marriage, as I stared up at the ceiling anxiously waiting for him to finish. He would leave little notes, or a little flower on the bathroom mirror or in my car. So many little things he would do to show me that he loved me and wasn’t going to let this marriage end easily.</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e1744">It just irritated me. I thought, <i>Can’t he understand that I don’t love him, that I don’t want to be with him anymore? Why is he trying so hard?</i> I didn’t feel that high “in love” feeling for him anymore. My needs weren’t being met so I wanted out—very selfish and immature. . . .</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e1749">I was emotionally going through something that neither of us really understood, but he stayed there and loved me through it. I’ll spare you all the little extra details, but I eventually broke. No woman in her right mind could let go of that much love and commitment.</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e1751">[Now] I am very much in love with my husband. I’ve learned that love is not a feeling, it’s a choice, a commitment. We didn’t become a statistic because my husband chose to love me no matter what my reaction toward him would be. It’s really humbling to look back and see how loving and patient he was with me (trust me, it wasn’t easy) and how he, only through the strength of Christ, saved our marriage. I can’t say we’re completely out of the tunnel yet, but we are certainly very close.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1753">There is really little to add to this woman’s story except, “Amen.” Her husband understood, even when it seemed there was no way to understand. Her husband engaged her even when she would roll her eyes to the ceiling as he prayed (talk about disrespect, not to mention irreverence). The bottom line is, he won the game—<i>they</i> won the game —and they are together today because he was willing to do whatever it took to stop the Crazy Cycle. Then she finally got the message and wanted to stop it too.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1758">No matter how desperate or hopeless a marriage may seem, if husband and wife both have basic goodwill in their hearts, they can stop the Crazy Cycle. But like the husband who never gave up, they have to be willing to do whatever it takes. In saying “do whatever it takes,” I mean winning within the boundaries of “the law of Christ” (1 Corinthians 9:21). Christ’s law may mean constant giving and forgiving: “Love covers a multitude of sins” (1 Peter 4:8; Matthew 5:38-46). But Christ’s law may also mean turning someone away from “a multitude of sins” (James 5:20; Matthew 18:15). Love must be tough. To know which approach to take in your marriage, seek godly, wise counsel.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1760">Of course, doing whatever it takes can take you where you may not want to go. As I counsel couples and conduct seminars, I continually find wives who have been so hurt and even abused that they don’t think they can forgive their husbands. And I find husbands who just don’t know what to do when she won’t forgive. They keep saying to themselves that they’ve blown it again. And they eventually start thinking, <i>Could anybody live with this woman? I’m certainly not having much luck.</i> We’ll look at these two concerns in chapter 7.</p>
