  <br />
  LOYALTY—SHE NEEDS TO<br />
  KNOW YOU’RE COMMITTED</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2793"><span class="dcap" id="d12e2794">I</span>t happens in almost every marriage. Wanting reassurance about his love, she asks, “How much do you love me? Will you love me when I’m old and gray? If I’m an invalid? What if I get Alzheimer’s?”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2797">There are two ways a husband can go with this question. The wrong way leads straight back to the Crazy Cycle, and it involves having a little fun at your wife’s expense. You’re just kidding, of course, so you say, “What’s the matter? Afraid I’ll trade you in for a new model? Don’t be silly, I plan to keep you around . . . at least for a while.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2799">A wife may know that her husband is just kidding when he says things like this, but the big, dumb buck is stepping on her air hose, nonetheless. When she asks, “Do you love me?” she’s not asking for information; she’s asking for reassurance.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2801"><i>A woman always likes to hear her husband exclaim, “You alone are ‘my love’ ”(Song of Solomon 2:10 KJV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2804">The much smarter and wiser answer to her question is, “Of course I love you, and we’regoing to get old and gray together.” Then she’ll probably ask, “Why?” or “What is it that you love about me?” She wants to draw this out of you because reassurance of your love energizes her.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2806">A wife <i>must</i> have reassurance. As one wife writes:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e2811">We have a wonderful marriage and friendship, yet we find ourselves on the Crazy Cycle in our hectic lives, and the info we gained at your conference has given us a new understanding of one another. I had been trying to explain the times when I felt “emotionally disconnected” from him. Now he finally understands. . . . We are able to talk now, and when I say I feel disconnected he says, “I am sorry and I don’t want you to feel that way.” We both walked away with a feeling of confidence knowing that we both have a commitment to the Lord first [and then to each other]. We feel very lucky and blessed. . . . I guess I just feel like I have a renewed relationship with my husband.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2813">SHE’S A ONE-MAN WOMAN, AND HE’S . . . ?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2815">Your wife knows she’s a one-man woman, that she’s committed to you, but she may wonder at times if you are a one-woman man. It’s perfectly natural for a wife to think this, particularly when she sees her husband being attracted by some beautiful female walking by or on TV. She takes this as a possibility that he might be unfaithful to her. To be candid, she is insecure in this area and she needs reassurance, not jokes and teasing.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2817"><i>Every woman wants her husband to be “faithful to his wife”(Titus 1:6 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2821">Let’s look at the other side of the coin.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2823">Suppose your wife came home and said, “Do you know that Dave Smith down the street just got his third promotion? Well, my good friend, Marge, works in his office and she says people stop at his desk all the time to get counsel. The word is that he’s a real man’s man. You know he runs marathons—and lifts weights at his health club. He’s making excellent money and spends a lot of it on his wife and kids. When are you going to start working out and getting rid of that potbelly? And when is your next promotion coming up? We could sure use some more money around here.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2825">Now, that speech is more than overstated, but you get the idea. If your wife said anything along those lines, it wouldn’t make you feel good. In fact, depending on the kind of day or week you’ve had, you might be devastated.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2827">IT’S A “SWIMSUIT ISSUE” WORLD</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2829">Have you ever thought about how difficult it is for a wife in today’s sex-happy, pornography-riddled, “swimsuit issue” world? The way in which she looks at that world through her pink sunglasses is much different than the way you look at it through your blue ones. That is why Job had the right idea: “I made an agreement with my eyes. I promised not to look at another woman with sexual longing (Job 3:11 NIRV). Job recognized that “sinful people are destroyed. Trouble comes to those who do what is wrong” (Job 31:3 NIRV). Job understood the impact of his actions, not only on his spiritual life but also on his relationship to his wife.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2831"><i>The phrase “Drink water from your own well” (Proverbs 5:15 NIRV) means be faithful to your own wife.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2834">All husbands might learn from Job at this point. When a woman senses that her husband has made a covenant with God and that he’s trying to make Jesus the Lord of his life in every area, including his marriage, she feels more secure. When she is assured of her husband’s love and loyalty, she is energized and motivated. This is the way God has made her, and this is why the covenant of marriage is based upon loyalty—until death do you part.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2836">Your wife feels so deeply what the lover in Song of Solomon expressed: “Keep me close to yourself like the ring on your finger” (8:6 NIRV). The custom of giving each other a ring during your wedding ceremony captures the idea behind this verse. And, oh, the symbolism of that ring to a woman! The ring tells her she is loved and no longer alone! There is one person in the world who will be loyal to her—for life, not “until divorce do you part.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2838">Many men do not wear wedding rings because of the kind of job they do, because they engage in sports, or because they have put on a few pounds through the years and the ring no longer fits. But a ring that no longer fits can be enlarged, or you can purchase another one for a few dollars. Rings don’t cost that much, and even if you have to take it off now and then while at work or playing a game, you can always slip it right back on. A wedding ring is a sign of loyalty. No husband should leave home without one.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2840">And while you are sure to wear a wedding ring, also be sure to never bring up the “D” word, even in jest. The word <i>divorce</i> does not make your wife feel secure, no matter what the context. Why start slipping back toward the Crazy Cycle? Do everything you can to let your wife know you are committed to her for as long as you both shall live.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2845">ARE YOU BEING AS LOYAL AS YOU COULD BE?</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2848"><i>“Don’t break your promise to the wife you marrried when you were young.‘I hate divorce,’ says the LORD God of Israel”(Malachi 2:15–16 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2851">Malachi 2:14–15 is a helpful reminder of how God feels about marital loyalty. In this passage the prophet is confronting the Israelites for breaking their marriage bonds rather freely. Divorce was rampant, and that’s why Malachi said that “the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and wife by covenant. . . . Take heed then to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your youth.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2853">At this point you may be saying, “Emerson, aren’t you pushing it a little bit? I may need some help with being as loving as I should be, but I’m not ‘dealing treacherously with my wife.’ ”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2855">I’m not saying that you or any other good-willed husband are being treacherous toward your wife. This passage from Malachi, however, is a good reminder to do some self-evaluation. What is going on in your spirit? What are you feeling for your wife? Are you being open and understanding? Are you being as loyal to her as you could be?</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2857">It’s no coincidence that the very first words Malachi uses as he goes on to verse 16 are: “ ‘For I hate divorce!’ says the LORD, the God of Israel.” Malachi is describing a situation that began with the Crazy Cycle. The Israelites knew nothing about that term, but they were on the Crazy Cycle nonetheless. That’s why I’m urging you to stay open and on the Energizing Cycle (see page 115) in order to avoid all the craziness you can. Remember, without love, she reacts. And a big part of being loving is to be loyal in every way.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2859">ROBERTSON MCQUILKIN KEPT HIS PROMISE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2861">One of the finest examples of a loyal husband I have found is the story of Robertson McQuilkin, who left his position as president of Columbia Bible College and Seminary<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5419" id="d12e2863">1</a></sup> after twenty-two years because his wife had developed Alzheimer’s disease. The disease had progressed to the point where his wife simply could not stand having him gone, even for a few hours. She would actually think he was “lost” and would go in search of him after he left home for work.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2867"><i>“Many claim to have love that never fails.But who can find a faithful man?”(Proverbs 20:6 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2870">It was clear to McQuilkin that his wife now needed him full time. His decision was difficult, but in a way it was simple. He said, “The decision was made in a way forty-two years ago when I promised to care for Muriel in sickness and in health ‘til death do us part.’ ”<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5423" id="d12e2872">2</a></sup>McQuilkin went on to say that he wanted to be a man of his word, and he also wanted to be fair. His wife had cared for him sacrificially during all of those forty-two years, and if he cared for her for the next forty years, he still would not be out of her debt.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2876"></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e2877"><i>“All of you should honor marriage. You should keep the marriage bed pure” (Hebrews 13:4 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2881">For McQuilkin, this simple decision was the only option for him, but there was more to it than just keeping a promise and being fair. “As I watch her brave descent into oblivion, Muriel is the joy of my life,” he said. “Daily I discern new manifestations of the kind of person she is; the wife I always loved.”<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5430" id="d12e2883">3</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2886">McQuilkin wrote a book about his experience, <i>A Promise Kept</i>, and in it he mentioned how startled he was by the response to his resignation as president of Columbia Bible College and Seminary to care for his wife. Husbands and wives renewed marriage vows. Pastors told his story during sermons. It was all a mystery to him until a distinguished oncologist, who dealt constantly with dying people, told him, “Almost all women stand by their men; very few men stand by their women.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2891">WHY YOU SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY GOOD TO YOUR DAUGHTERS</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e2893">That all women stand by their men and few men stand by their women is obviously a generalization. There are always exceptions, and Robertson McQuilkin is an incredible example. But the reasoning behind this rule of thumb is that women are much more the natural caretakers than men. There is an old saying, “Be good to your sons, but be especially good to your daughters.” Why? Because if you become a widower and infirm in your old age, it is your daughter who will do everything in her power to convince her own husband to move into the area where you live so she can be near you to take care of you. This kind of loyalty is part of a woman’s spirit.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2895">When your wife becomes a bit insecure and moves toward you with questions about how much you love her or why you love her or if you will ever leave her, you might feel it’s some kind of trap. You may think you’re being set up so she can condemn you and show you disrespect if you hesitate with your answer. But that’s not it at all. She moves toward you in that fashion because she is loyal to you and needs reassurance of your loyalty to her.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2897">You may have heard this old joke. A group of men were golfing one day and four of them were on the eighteenth tee, ready to tee off. Just then a funeral procession went by, and one of the men stood up straight, took off his hat, and put it over his heart. His golf buddies were stunned. Someone said, “We’ve never seen anyone ready to tee off and then stop to put his hat over his heart to honor a funeral procession. That’s amazing.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2899">The man answered, “Yeah, she was a great woman. We were married forty-three years.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e2901">Play golf or attend your wife’s funeral? Absurd, of course, and possibly funny to a group of men. But I guarantee that your wife will not think this joke is any funnier than being teased about “being turned in for a new model.” She is not built to appreciate that kind of humor. She is so constructed that she appreciates loyalty and commitment. Assuring her of that will keep you both on the Energizing Cycle.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e2903">SHE IS ASSURED OF YOUR LOYALTY WHEN . . .</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2905">• you speak highly of her in front of others.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2907">• you are involved in things important to her.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2910">• you help her make decisions, such as ones regarding the children.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2912">• you don’t correct her in front of the children.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2914">• you don’t look lustfully at other women.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2918">• you are never critical of her or your children in front of others.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2920">• you include her in social gatherings when others may leave their spouses home.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2922">• you tell the kids, “Don’t speak to your mother that way!”</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2924">• you call and let her know your plans.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e2926">• you keep commitments.</p>
