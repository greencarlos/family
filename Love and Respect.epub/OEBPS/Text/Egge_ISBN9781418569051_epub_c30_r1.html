  <br />
  AUTHORITY—APPRECIATE<br />
  HIS DESIRE TO SERVE<br />
  AND TO LEAD</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3647"><span class="dcap" id="d12e3648">I</span>t was question-and-answer time in one of our Love and Respect Conferences, and the topic was, “The Husband’s Authority in the Home.” An eager young wife said, “I want him to be the head; I want him to be the leader. I just want to make sure that he makes decisions in keeping with what I want.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3651">The room broke into laughter—men as well as women (perhaps a lot of the men present knew exactly what she was talking about). The gal turned beet red. She had made the comment in all innocence. She wasn’t being belligerent or malicious or trying to demand her rights. She was just being honest. I had to chuckle a little myself. Her innocent remark reminded me of a story I chose not to share at that moment because I wanted to spare her more embarrassment. It seems a couple got married and decided that he would make all the major decisions and she would make all the minor decisions. After twenty years, he realized that there had not been one major decision yet.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3653">WHO’S THE BOSS AT YOUR HOUSE?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3655">In today’s feminist-dominated culture, the question of, “Who’s the boss?” can be a source of humor or of conflict. Many men have been cowed by the feminist argument that men and women are totally equal, and husbands don’t have any more authority than their wives do.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3657">But for the Christian couple, the question is, what does the Bible teach about who has authority in the home? We have already seen in chapter 17 that Paul lays out the biblical hierarchy of the home: The man is the head, and the wife is to be subject to him (see Ephesians 5:22–23). And we have seen that the good-willed husband does not try to use his position of head as some kind of club to beat down his wife and his children. He acts responsibly—and lovingly—to be the leader that God has asked him to be.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3659">Nonetheless, the subject of male headship and authority is a sensitive one. The young woman who said her husband is to be the head and make the decisions as long as his decisions met with her approval is not alone. Many wives feel the same way. In fact, many wives would tell you that they are better decision-makers than their husbands, and they often are. They have better judgment than their husbands on many fronts, yet they are stuck with this concept of having to defer to their husbands and let them “be the boss.”</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3661"><i>A wife’s deferential attitude should not undermine her God-given abilities: “She considers a field and buys it; from her earnings she plants a vineyard” (Proverbs 31:16).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3664">A wife who runs her own business and admits she has a strong personality struggles with submitting to a husband who is “not much of an encourager.” She realizes the issue is really “between me and God,” and she knows that if she could trust the Lord:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3666">. . . it would be so much more peaceful. Wow, why is it so hard to lay it down? I can see it, and I believe it, but I’m not doing it. I hear my daughter, who is fifteen, talk about never getting married because she will never submit to a man, and I feel very ashamed. We are having a lot of good talks about this stuff, but, of course, more is caught than taught, and I want to get it right. So, anyhow, I am going to keep at it, and by God’s grace get it right! (And try not to strangle my husband in the process.)</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3668">DOES SCRIPTURE TEACH “MUTUAL SUBMISSION”?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3671">Many Christian wives are uneasy with subjects like headship and authority. When Paul pens lines like Ephesians 5:22–23, he sounds hopelessly sexist, especially to women who have domineering husbands. And it doesn’t help any when he adds in 1 Timothy 2:12: “I do not allow a woman to . . . exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.” In recent years there has been a movement in the church among some scholars and teachers to suggest that the Bible talks about “mutual submission”—that is, that men and women are to be equally subject to one another. The text that is used for this position is Ephesians 5:21: “Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ” (NIV).</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3673"><i>When women “follow the lead of their husbands” (Titus 2:5 NIRV), they trust God to guide their decisions.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3676">According to the mutual submission point of view, Ephesians 5:21 means that “every Christian should be subject to every other Christian, and wives and husbands, especially, should be ‘subject to one another.’”<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5517" id="d12e3678">1</a></sup> The idea behind mutual submission in this sense is that the wife does not owe submission of any unique kind to her husband.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3682">But if this is true, it is hard to explain Ephesians 5:22, where wives are clearly told to “submit to your husbands <i>as to the Lord</i> ” (NIV; italics mine<i>)</i>. As I mentioned in chapter 17, the Greek word for “submit” is <i>hupotasso,</i> which means to rank under or place under. As a wife places herself under her husband’s protection and provision, there will come moments when disagreements arise. Honest stalemates can still happen. If a decision must be made, the wife is called upon to defer to her husband, trusting God to guide him to make a decision out of love for her as the responsible head of the marriage.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3693">What, then, did Paul mean when he said Christians should submit to one another? For husbands and wives, I believe the answer is found in Love and Respect. If husband and wife have a conflict over how to spend money, for example, the husband “submits” to his wife by meeting her need to feel that he loves her in spite of the conflict. He submits to her need for love (see Ephesians 5:21, 25). On the other side, the wife “submits” to her husband during a conflict by meeting her husband’s need to feel that she respects him in spite of the unresolved issue. She submits to his need for respect (see Ephesians 5:21–22, 33).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3695">Note that Paul and Peter both begin their discussions of marriage by speaking of submission (see Ephesians 5:22 and 1 Peter 3:1), but they end their discussion by speaking of respect (see Ephesians 5:33 and 1 Peter 3:7). The bottom line is that if husband and wife approach each other with the Love and Respect Connection in mind, all will be well in the marriage, even if a decision appears to be stalemated. A wife who attended our Love and Respect Conference wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3697">I was struck by the “back to basics.” There is much talk about communication in marriage, and meeting each other’s needs, when the simple solution to our marriage problems is in God’s Word. We say that the Word gives us what we need for life and godliness but stray from that into popular psychology. I periodically read the Ephesians passage to remind myself of submission. Although humbling myself to submit is hard, having a considerate, wise Christian husband makes it easier.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3699">HUSBANDS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO “MAKE THE CALL”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3701">Obviously, someone can say, “All right, Emerson, suppose love and respect are both present—he wants to love her and she wants to respect him. Which way should the decision go? Who is going to make the call?” I believe that in most cases when love and respect are both present, couples resolve the conflict. Two good-willed people who feel loved and respected almost always discover a creative alternative that resolves the conflict.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3703">When love and respect are present in the marriage, husbands and wives process things far more wisely. They accept the fact that a degree of conflict is inevitable in a marriage relationship. As the conversation progresses, neither one overstates his or her position. No one “loses it” emotionally. Proposals are made to solve the conflict. There are offers and counteroffers. There is give and take. All of this results yin a course of action that makes sense to both of them.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3705"><i>There are times when a wife “must obey God rather than men”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3709"><i>(Acts 5:29).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3712">We have already seen that Paul clearly teaches that there are times when wives should submit to their husbands as head of the household (see Ephesians 5:22–23). Does this mean that a wife must submit to something illegal, wrong, or evil? Should she go along with being beaten by her husband or watching him beat the children? Should she submit to his plans to do something dishonest or unethical? The clear scriptural answer is, of course not, because that would be preposterous. When a man acts in this way, he is not a good-willed husband, and he forfeits his right to be head and to be followed. A wife’s submission to God takes precedence over her submission to her husband. She is not to sin against Christ in order to defer to her husband. (Read the story of Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1–11.) And, sadly, let me add, a wife may need to physically separate from her husband (1 Corinthians 7:11) or divorce him for adultery (Matthew 19:9).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3714">As we have seen so far, there is much a husband and wife can do to “mutually submit” to one another through love and respect. But when somebody has to call the shots, the husband is responsible to do it. How should a wife act if she strongly disagrees with her husband about some issue? First Timothy 2:12 has some advice. Paul writes, “I do not allow a woman to . . . exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.” Now, if Paul ever penned a sexist line, this would seem to be it. But the Bible is not sexist. The Bible is sharing what the Hebrew mind understood about wisdom and real empowerment. As discussed in part 1, women can win their husbands without a word through their “chaste and respectful behavior” (1 Peter 3:1–2). Is Peter saying that women are insignificant? Of course not. What he is saying is that your quiet and gentle spirit will melt your man’s heart.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3716">If you’re in a conflict and you remain respectful and quiet as you distance yourself a bit instead of preaching, lecturing, or criticizing, what will he do? Well, it depends. If your quietness is the right kind of quietness—respectful and dignified, not pouty and sour—he will move toward you. He will want to comfort you and take care of you. In essence, he will want to show you love. For the good-willed husband, the wife’s quiet and respectful behavior will act as a magnet.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3718"><i>“Wives, follow the lead of your husbands. . . . Then let them be won to Christ without words by seeing how their wives behave”</i></p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e3721"><i>(1 Peter 3:1 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3724">Feminists say the Bible puts down women. Actually, the Bible holds up women and gives them advice on how to realize their fondest desires. You don’t have to fight. You don’t have to push and push and struggle to understand him as you try to move closer only to have him coldly move away. There is another way to get his love, and the Bible tells you what it is. Your quiet and respectful behavior will win him. This is the key to empowerment: <i>you get what you want by giving him what he wants.</i></p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3728">AUTHORITY MUST COME WITH RESPONSIBILITY</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3730">What your husband wants is your acknowledgment that he is the leader, the one in authority. This is not to grind you under or treat you as inferior. It is only to say that because God has made your husband responsible (review Ephesians 5:25–33), he needs the authority to carry out that responsibility. No smoothly running organization can have two heads. To set up a marriage with two equals at the head is to set it up for failure. That is one of the big reasons that people are divorcing right and left today. In essence, these marriages do not have anyone who is in charge. God knew someone had to be in charge, and that is why Scripture clearly teaches that, in order for things to work, the wife is called upon to defer to her husband.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3732">Wives often tell me that if they submit to their husbands, it means burying their brains and becoming a doormat. If you want to work with your husband to reach mutually satisfying decisions most of the time, follow this principle:</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3734">GO ON RECORD WITH YOUR HUSBAND THAT YOU SEE HIM AS HAVING 51 PERCENT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND, THEREFORE, 51 PERCENT OF THE AUTHORITY.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3737">Tell him that you see him as having more authority because he has more responsibility before God—the responsibility to die for you, if necessary. My prediction is that the nature of your arguments and disagreements will change dramatically. Once you go on record about his authority, he will not feel you are trying to be the boss. As you submit (which simply means recognizing his biblically given authority), you will not be a doormat. In fact, you will get your way far more often than you would if you “stood up for your rights,” which usually means being disrespectful.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3739">Many wives are so focused on their own feelings and fears that they ignore their husband’s feelings and fears. Ironically, when a wife fears she will bury her brains, she creates fear in him that he’ll be called brainless. And fearing she’ll become a doormat, she creates fear in him that he’ll be walked on. Many husbands get stubborn and resist their wives’ requests in order to send a message: “You aren’t in charge of me.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3741">Our secular, feminist culture likes to argue that men are dominant in the home—and it’s true that some are. More often, however, among good-willed couples, if there are one hundred decisions over a three-month period related to the family, the wife will have a strong opinion on ninety-nine of them, and her opinion will usually be respected and have strong influence. Unfortunately, in many marriages either spouse may have goodwill but not always have good sense. A man can run roughshod; a wife can come across as too forceful and coercive in the home. She isn’t this way outside the home, but within the family, with him, she gets aggressive.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3743">Another positive strategy for many a wife would be to defer more to her husband. I often hear many wives complain that their husbands are too disconnected and passive on family matters. But why is he passive? Quite likely in the past, every time he tried to step up to the plate, she had a better idea. After a while, he just let her have her way. If this could be your problem, submission, respect, and quietness will engage your husband and draw him out. This does not put you down or undermine your equality; in fact, it will create real equality.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3745">When you go on record that your husband is 51 percent in charge, this actually gives you more of a platform for sharing the opinions from your deepest heart. Remember, if a husband is acting in a dominating way, he is usually trying to maintain control. His foolish reasoning tells him that if he maintains complete control, he will be respected. Ironically, if his wife gives him the respect he is looking for, he will back off and be less controlling! Trust me. God knows what He is revealing. If you haven’t gone on record about his 51 percent, do it now!<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5524" id="d12e3747">2</a></sup>(To check your attitude, see appendix B.)</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3751">WHICH MESSAGE DO YOU WANT TO SEND?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e3753">Granted, deferring to your husband isn’t always easy, especially if you feel he doesn’t deserve your respect. One woman wrote to tell me that she acted very disrespectfully in order to send a message to her husband that she felt unloved. She thought this would motivate him to love her and appreciate her, but all the while she was unsupportive of his endeavors, belittling his abilities, undermining his decisions, resistant to his counsel, unfriendly, and disinterested in physical intimacy. She said, “I thought if I did all of this, he’d get the message that I was hurting, frustrated, and angry and that he’d move toward me with understanding and love.” But she wept as she realized she had so wounded him that he wouldn’t even have sex with her. It took years for him to reopen emotionally to her.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3755">By comparison, I heard from a woman who granted her husband authority in the nitty-gritty area of bedtime. She wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3757">My husband leaves for work real early. I have never been a real stickler on early bedtimes. He now enforces bedtime curfew with the kids, and I back him fully, so he can get his undisturbed and deserved full night of sleep. . . . I’m now aware that my allowing the kids to stay up late not only undermined and disrespected [my husband] but his work effort was also disrespected because it appeared as if I didn’t care that he was tired after working all day.</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e3759">I now leave decisions to him to administer, and it makes me smile sometimes because he’ll ask me in private for my opinion. Then we discuss it and I tell him I respect whatever decision he makes. He even told me last week that I “built him up.” . . . Since my respectful attitude, my husband has told me that he loves me more [often] in the last few months than over the last ten years!</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3761">Appreciating—and respecting—your husband’s desire to serve you and lead the family takes faith, courage, and strength on your part. But I predict it will work. As one wife told me, “The picture-perfect marriage in my mind is not necessarily the one that God has intended for me. I finally realized that when I submit to His control and stop trying to orchestrate my ideas . . . everything falls into place.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e3764">Grant your husband authority, as Scripture describes it, and things are much more likely to fall into place. If you try to undermine his authority or subtly rebel against it, the Crazy Cycle will spring to life. A woman who teaches other women in her church on the topic of marriage puts it better than I ever could:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e3766">I believe that ultimately a refusal to submit to or respect your husband is a refusal to trust in God. If we as women believe that God is working in our lives and in our husbands’ lives, and we can place ourselves under His authority, then we can submit to and respect our husbands.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e3768">THE WILL FEEL YOU APPRECIATE HIS AUTHORITY AND LEADERSHIP WHEN . . .</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3770">• you tell him you are thankful for his strength and enjoy being able to lean on him at times.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3772">• you support his self-image as a leader.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3774">• you never say, “You’re responsible but we’re still equal, so don’t make a decision I don’t agree with.”</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3776">• you praise his good decisions.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3778">• you are gracious if he makes a bad decision.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3780">• you disagree with him only in private and honor his authority in front of the kids.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3782">• you give your reasons for disagreeing quietly and reasonably, but you never attack his right to lead.</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e3784">• you do not play “head games” with him to make him back down and be a “loving peacemaker.”</p>
