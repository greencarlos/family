  WHY SHE WON’T RESPECT;<br />
  WHY HE WON’T LOVE</a></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e985"><span class="dcap" id="d12e986">L</span>earning to decipher your spouse’s code isn’t always done in a day, a month, or even a year. Listen to this husband who came to me for counsel because he sincerely was trying to love his wife. He writes:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e989">Thanks for all your suggestions and support. [But] I remain perplexed at the chasm that exists between my perception and reality. When I began this endeavor, I had hope but low expectations, and I was happy to see how quick and positive the effects of “loving” behavior are. It was not difficult to bite my tongue and not “fight back” when I prepared myself for it. I think that while I felt apologetic, I can easily be humble and pretty much take anything that comes my way.</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e991">The difficulty begins when I begin to see things return to normal. When I let my guard down, I begin to talk or share and it turns out that underneath things are very volatile and sensitive. When things started to go bad last week, it happened extremely fast and I was surprised to hear how all the same issues remain at the same raw and grim level. I hate hearing that I am her enemy. It is painful to hear her ask, “Why do you want to crush my spirit?” It is extremely difficult to not explode in despair when I hear her say that she doesn’t believe that I love her, or that I will never change, or that she made a mistake and I am not the man she thought I was.</p>

  <p class="ext1" id="d12e993">It sure makes it seem that the road is long and possibly fruitless. Amidst getting angry, and blaming her, and the gambit of contorted emotional upheavals, I hear you saying that it is rarely the content but rather the manner of delivery that causes problems and I cringe at my inability to communicate effectively. Things have gotten so grossly out of shape and I feel shamed that I’ve been blind and let them get so bad. I also feel a little overwhelmed that all this effort and tolerance will only get us to some point of mediocrity, and that at the slightest perturbation everything will come tumbling down again.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e995"><i>Realizing marriage demanded permanence and work, the disciples complained, “If the relationship . . . is like this, it is better not to marry”(Matthew 19:10).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e998">Few men can articulate the male struggle as well as this man does. His wife is crying out for love, but she isn’t helping at all because of her contempt. Why do some women feel so free to make comments like, “You’re not the man I thought you were” to their husbands and expect them to remain unaffected? How do wives expect husbands to respond with love to this kind of barrage? At the same time, how do men get themselves in such a pickle by being so blind in the first place?</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1000">UNCONDITIONAL RESPECT—AN OXYMORON?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1002">When I talk to wives, they have no trouble grasping the concept of unconditional love. After all, they are wired that way. But when I men tion showing unconditional respect for husbands, it’s a much harder sell. Few seem to have considered 1 Peter 3:1–2. The apostle Peter reveals that husbands who “are disobedient to the word” (meaning they are undeserving of respect) “may be won . . . by . . . respectful behavior.” A simple application is that a wife is to display a respectful facial expression and tone when he fails to be the man she wants. She can give her husband unconditional respect in tone and expression while confronting his unloving behavior and without endorsing his unloving reactions. He may deserve contempt, but that doesn’t win him any more than harshness and anger wins the heart of a woman.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1004">Interestingly, at first men don’t grasp the idea of unconditional respect either. Wives and husbands believe respect ought to be earned. The wife feels her husband doesn’t deserve respect. The husband wants to earn respect, but he doesn’t feel he deserves the kind of disrespect he’s getting from his wife.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1006"><i>The Bible teaches unconditional respect: “Show proper respect to everyone.. . . Not only to those who are good and considerate . . . but . . . harsh”(1 Peter 2:17–18 NIV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1010">To suggest that respect for men should be unconditional gets some wives downright upset. Repeatedly, I hear comments like these from wives: “How can I show respect for him when he comes across as so unloving?” . . . “He doesn’t deserve respect; he has hurt me” . . . “I love him, but I get so frustrated and angry I don’t want to respect him” . . . “Love is what matters. If he loved me as I need to be loved, maybe I would have stronger feelings of respect” . . . “Yes, I have things to deal with, but the major problem is with him and he needs to change. The truth is he needs to love and respect me far better than he does.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1012">Time and again I’ve had women tell me they’ve never heard the two words <i>unconditional respect</i> put together in the context of a relationship. For them, it is literally an oxymoron (a term created by putting together two words that appear to be incongruous or contradictory).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1017">A licensed counselor who used my materials and became a thorough believer in the power of the Love and Respect message wrote to say:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1019">Just yesterday, I talked to two new female clients who were wanting to save their marriages that were barely alive. I asked them if they loved their husbands. Without hesitation they said, “Yes.” I then asked if they respected their husbands. I got nothing but hesitation! They sputtered like an old car needing a tune-up. One of them admitted that she was quite the reader, but she had never heard anything like this before. She asked me how she was supposed to respect her husband unconditionally. I told her in the same way that he was supposed to love her unconditionally. It’s only with God’s help. She smiled.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1021">Note that these two wives had no problem with the concept of unconditional love. Women never think of <i>that</i> as an oxymoron. To them, the words <i>unconditional love</i> aren’t contradictory at all, and when they don’t receive love from their husbands, they let them know it. Women are much more expressive-responsive than men, who tend to compartmentalize their emotions. To put it simply, women are much more apt to show how they feel while men shut down. Men don’t know how to deal with the fact that they aren’t respected, and they can’t put a voice to their feelings. The husbands think, <i>Well, if that’s the way she feels, there’s nothing I can do. If I have to earn her respect and I’m that bad as a person, then I guess I’ll just forget it.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1031">When the wife flatly says her husband will have to earn her respect before she gives him any, she leaves the husband in a lose-lose situation. Now he’s responsible for both love and respect in the relationship. He must unconditionally love his wife <i>and</i> he also must earn her respect. Is it any wonder he shuts down in the face of all that?</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1036">IT ALL GOES BACK TO PINK AND BLUE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1038">Respect for husbands is an unfamiliar idea for many wives, but there certainly are reasons for their attitude. Part of it goes back to those pink and blue sunglasses and hearing aids. As one wife put it, “We think so differently. I don’t even relate to what he considers respect (or the lack of it).”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1040">Another obvious reason for the respect gap in women is the crude and unloving behavior of their husbands. I am well aware that many a wife has good reasons to get in her husband’s face—I have heard it all for more than a quarter of a century. But that’s not the total picture. There is also the cultural mind-set. For the past forty years, the American church has preached unconditional love. I preached it for many years in my own church, as I remained clueless about the importance of unconditional respect. During those years I was continually frustrated as a male counselor, and so were the women who came seeking my advice. Why couldn’t husbands love their wives as their wives needed to be loved? It wasn’t that they lacked the knowledge—they showed plenty of that back in courtship days. But now that they were married the husbands seemed to lack motivation to love their wives. They seemed less energized about their marriages. Something was missing.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1042"><i>By ignoring unconditional respect for husbands, I had not been “accurately handling the word of truth”(2 Timothy 2:15).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1045">Then I realized that, in stressing unconditional love, I was teaching the truth but only half the truth. Paul’s advice in Ephesians 5:25 and 28 is sound: “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. . . . Husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself ” (NIV). But all of the emphasis on unconditional love hadn’t motivated or equipped many men to be loving, at least not as loving as their wives would like. What was missing was that very short phrase, “the wife must respect her husband” (Ephesians 5:33 NIV).<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5305" id="d12e1047">1</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1051">As I changed my message to include the whole truth—love <i>and</i> respect—I got interesting reactions. In one case I spoke twice to a group of two hundred women on the topic of respecting their husbands. I made myself available for a third talk, but the leadership of the group declined. Instead, they asked a female friend of mine to address the topic: “How to Love Your Husband.” My friend had heard me speak, and she dropped me a note: “That was your point! How to love your husband.” She could not believe how this group of women had missed it. The way to fully love a husband is to respect him in ways that are meaningful to him.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1056">I survived being “fired” by that group of women and went on to spread the message of unconditional respect everywhere I could. And many wives are getting that message, including one who reported:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1058">I have led several studies on being a godly wife and have read and hopefully applied lots of biblical marriage resources. But I knew something was still missing even in my own relationship. . . . I could not figure out why my husband was staying somewhat aggravated with me and I was definitely not receiving the love and affection that I so desired. Now I realize that I have been showing him disrespect without ever dreaming that was what was being communicated. . . . I tried . . . respect . . . I was amazed at the result. My husband is definitely not a sweet talker. He is an outdoorsman who hunts all over the world. That’s our business. Anyway, I thought this feels kind of silly but I said to him, “Honey, I couldn’t sleep very well last night so I spent a lot of time thinking of all the things I respect about you” (which was true). He did not respond but I felt a softening in the air. Two days later, after spending all day in the duck blind with several men, he said to me, “I missed you today. I wish you could have gone with me. I thought all day about what a sweet girl you are.” I nearly laughed out loud—he called me a sweet girl—I’m a grandmother—but, oh, it is so fun to feel loved. I am now aware of so many ways that I was communicating disrespect without meaning to.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1060">Respect does something to the soul of a man. God made him that way.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1062">WHAT ABOUT ARETHA AND R-E-S-P-E-C-T?</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1064">I sometimes get the question, “You say women need love and men need respect. Isn’t the opposite just as true? Don’t gals need respect and guys need love?” My answer is, of course, women need respect and guys need love, but I’m talking about the primary drive in each sex. Sometimes this gets mixed up. Back in the late 1960s, when the feminist movement<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5312" id="d12e1066">2</a></sup> was hitting its stride, Aretha Franklin released a hit record entitled “R-E-S-P-E-C-T,” which clearly sent the message that all women were asking for was a little respect when they got home. Respect is what women needed, and they “had to have it.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1070">“R-E-S-P-E-C-T” became something of a theme song for many women, but what most of them did not realize is that the song was really written by a man—Otis Redding—two years before Aretha ever sang it. Otis released the song as a single on August 15, 1965, as his message to his wife. Does the irony of this strike you as it does me? Aretha had the right to sing “R-E-S-P-E-C-T” from a female point of view, of course. A woman does need respect, and if a man loves her properly, she will get that respect. But the primary meaning in Otis Redding’s song is a cry from a <i>man’s</i> deepest soul that says respect is what he needs and he’s “got to have it.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1075">Aretha Franklin’s hit song notwithstanding, I still believe that women want love far more than respect and men want respect far more than love. I’ll illustrate that from two rather divergent areas: the greeting card industry and the military. They are very different parts of our society, but both serve as examples of men’s and women’s deepest values.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1077">GREETING CARDS ARE ALL ABOUT LOVE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1079">Greeting cards are a clue into the minds and needs of women. Market studies show that, overwhelmingly, the majority of cards in the United States are purchased by women and given to women. Greeting cards are a multimillion-dollar business. Now, the card companies are not interested in ideology. They don’t want to change anyone’s mind. They are out to make money, so they produce what sells. Knowing that, I challenge you to find a card from a husband to a wife that says, “Baby, I really respect you.” You won’t see it. That card isn’t out there, because that is not what a wife wants to hear. Women are locked into love. Love is their mother tongue. I’m not criticizing that; I’m just pointing out the way God designed women. In fact, if love weren’t the woman’s deepest value, this world would be in very sad shape. Women are this way, and we men rejoice.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1081">Unfortunately, by that same token, you won’t find any greeting cards that wives send to their husbands, saying, “Baby, I really respect you.” Why not? Because they don’t sell either. When women buy greeting cards for their husbands, they want to express love for them; they don’t even think about respect. Sadly, the deepest yearning of husbands goes unmet because wives (and the card publishers) are locked into relaying sentiments of love.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1084">Those of you who have a son, consider how sad he may be never to hear from his wife, “I really respect you.” A need created in his soul by God will be overlooked because certain voices claim he doesn’t deserve it unless he meets and maintains your daughter-in-law’s romantic expectations. If his marriage is typical, after the first year, he will know his wife loves him but will feel she neither likes him nor admires him for who he is as a human being. If the pattern is like most, she will spend her energy seeking to help change him by her loving criticism and complaints, which eventually feel like contempt to him.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1086">RESPECT IS A MAN’S DEEPEST VALUE</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1088">Women need to learn how to understand and use the word <i>respect</i> because, in truth, respect is a man’s deepest value. Ever since I started developing the Love and Respect approach to marriage, I knew the Scriptures plainly taught about the male need for respect, and my own observations confirmed this. But I was always curious. Would these ideas stand up to statistical analysis? Would this need for respect by men show up in research done by a top-notch survey group? Yes, it would. In one national study, four hundred men were given a choice between going through two different negative experiences. If they were forced to choose one of the following, which would they prefer to endure?</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e1093">a) to be left alone and unloved in the world</p>

  <p class="ul2" id="d12e1095">b) to feel inadequate and disrespected by everyone</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1097">Seventy-four percent of these men said that if they were forced to choose, they would prefer being alone and unloved in the world.<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5316" id="d12e1099">3</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1102">For these men, the greater negative experience for their souls to endure would be to feel inadequate and disrespected by everyone. I have had numerous men confirm this research by telling me, “I would rather live with a wife who respected me but did not love me than live with a wife who loved me but did not respect me.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1104">These men are not saying that they are indifferent to love. They know they need love, but they need to feel respected even more than to feel loved. Perhaps a good analogy is water and food. We need both to survive, but we can live longer without food than without water. For men, love is like food and respect is like water. Enough said! <i>Respect is the key to motivating a husband.</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1108">A good illustration of how respect can motivate a man is found in our armed forces—the military. Because I attended a military academy from eighth grade to twelfth grade, I have had an interest in basic principles of military leadership. For instance, my observation is that great leaders motivated their troops through unconditional honor. Envision a U.S. Marine general speaking to his men after observing them in training maneuvers that did not go too well. “Men, I believe in you more than you believe in yourselves. Get your heads up. Look at me. I admire you more than you admire yourselves. Your performance stunk today, but I see more potential in this fighting unit than any in the world. Where you will be in six months will result in the world hearing of this fighting unit, and I am taking you there.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1110">When a general respects his men and believes in them more than they believe in themselves, these soldiers want to improve, they want to get better, they want to fulfill that potential this general sees in them. Such men want to serve. Why do you think they call it the military “service”?<sup><a href="../Text/Egge_ISBN9781418569051_epub_c44_r1.html#d12e5326" id="d12e1112">4</a></sup></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1115">Not only do men want to serve, but they are also willing to die in combat. There is something in many men, placed there by God, to fight and die for honor, to fight and die for women, children, and their buddies. When I attended Wheaton College, the chaplain there was Jim Hutchens, who had also been a chaplain in the Vietnam War. Jim told me that the Vietcong would wound an American soldier, knowing his buddies would seek to rescue him. Vietcong snipers would then seek to kill those who came out to try to drag the wounded man back to safety. He would often hear the heart cry of a GI: “I have to go.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1118"><i>A husband is geared to hear the command, “Take courage . . . be men and fight” (1 Samuel 4:9).</i></p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1121">I have to help Joe. I can’t leave him there. I’ve got to go. He’s my friend.” Honor and love compelled the American GI in Vietnam as it has down through every war in history. One husband wrote to me:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1123">I have been in the Air Guard for fourteen years with an additional six years of active duty. During your conference you made many references about men willing to die for their spouses or their nation. This certainly made an impression upon both of us. (My wife has always seen military service as equating to war and death. I see it as honor and duty.) I am committed not only to my country, but to the men I serve with. Only men who serve in such a capacity (military, firefighters, police officers) can understand the bonds that are formed and the loyalty you feel to one another.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1125">I am sure this man is not trying to discount the women who serve honorably in various capacities in the military, as well as in firefighting and police work. But I believe he is trying to state a deep truth that is true of most men. I have counseled enough husbands to know the same kind of honor and loyalty that drives the military man is also in action in his home. Unfortunately, there are voices in our culture that have been saying, “Don’t show respect to men; they don’t deserve it. They’ll treat you in a subservient way, or they’ll abuse you and even kill you.” This is true of a certain number of men, but I believe it is a lie concerning the vast majority. A man who has basic goodwill will serve his wife and even die for her. There is no expectation of the wife to die for her husband.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1127">Of course, there are wives who might push the point a bit. You may have heard the story about the woman who told her husband, “Oh, Harry, you keep saying you’d die for me, but you never do!” That’s just a story, of course, designed to get a smile or a laugh, but it isn’t funny when men who are willing to die for their wives are treated with contempt and no respect. One woman wrote to me to confess:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1129">Although a Bible student for most of my life, and a very spiritual person, I had given up, but then I read your statement that says: “Though there is more to love than dying for someone, it is a sad day when a man knows that he’d die for his wife because he loves her, yet he hears her continually complain, [‘You don’t love me.’]” The truth hit me powerfully in my spirit like no other thing has hit me concerning our marriage. I felt the kind of shame one feels when she knows she has done terribly wrong, and she knows not to even ask for forgiveness, and she knows that this one will take a long time to heal, but she knows this is one thing she won’t do again.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1131">This lady “gets it.”</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1133">HUSBANDS ARE TO VALUE WIVES AS EQUALS</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1135">Paul’s writings clearly command men to <i>agape</i>-love their wives (see Ephesians 5:22–33), but is there any place in Scripture where men are instructed to respect their wives as well? After teaching wives to behave respectfully before their husbands (see 1 Peter 3:1–2), Peter goes on to tell husbands to live in an understanding way with their wives “and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life” (1 Peter 3:7). When Peter uses the phrase “show her honor as a fellow heir,” he is telling husbands to value and prize their wives as equals within the grace of God. Paul concurs when he writes that in Christ, “there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1140">This concept of honoring your wife is also found in Ephesians 5, where Paul says husbands ought to love their wives as they do themselves. As Paul says, “No one ever hated his own flesh, but . . . cherishes it.” The passage clearly says that as a husband cherishes his own flesh he is to cherish his wife in the same way (see vv. 28–29). A wife longs to be that special person Paul describes. She wants to be cherished as a princess, not revered as a queen. She longs to be first in importance to him.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1142">It is as though she is the princess and he is the prince. In Ephesians 5:33, a husband has a need to be respected as the head, the one called upon to die. “Christ . . . is the head . . . [and] loved the church and gave Himself up for her” (Ephesians 5:23, 25). The prince goes into battle for the princess, not vice versa. Consequently, the princess does not seek to be respected as the “head.” Instead, she yearns to be honored, valued, and prized as a precious equal, “a fellow heir of the grace of life,” as Peter unfolds in 1 Peter 3:7.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1145">To carry further the word picture of the prince and princess, I believe the biblical order of things is that, as prince, the husband is to be considered “first among equals.” By that I mean he is her equal, but he is called upon to be the first to provide, to protect—and even to die if necessary. This is graphically illustrated on any sinking ship as lifeboats are put over the side. The cry is always, “Women and children first!”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1147">It’s not an accident that in every culture, as a rule, men are bigger and stronger than women. Is this not God’s visual aid concerning His purpose for men? When Nehemiah led his men in rebuilding the wall and fighting off the enemy, he urged them to “fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives” (Nehemiah 4:14). Something in a man longs for his wife to look up to him as he fulfills this role. And when she does, it motivates him, not because he is arrogant, but because of how God has constructed him. Few husbands walk around claiming, “I’m first among equals.” The husband with goodwill (and good sense) knows this isn’t his right, but it is his responsibility. She, on the other hand, possesses something within that thirsts to be valued as “first in importance.” Nothing energizes her more! She is not self-centered. God placed this in her by nature.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1149">When he honors her as first in importance and she respects him as first among equals, their marriage works. When he expects her to look up to him yet puts her down, he deflates her. When he feels she is trying to be a bossy queen, he cannot detect her real heart. When she expects him to protect her but then accuses him of being paternalistic (too fatherly) or condescending, she deflates him. When she feels he is trying to be “more than equal” or greater, she cannot detect his real heart.</p>

  <p class="h2" id="d12e1151">HUSBANDS: DO NOT SAY, “I TOLD YOU SO! ”</p>

  <p class="tx1" id="d12e1153">A word of caution must be given to husbands at this point. For many wives, hearing that the Bible teaches women to give unconditional respect to their husbands is a huge piece of information. It is often something wives may never have heard before in any form. A wise husband will not use this information as a weapon. Instead, he will be humble. He will let his wife process what she has learned and then let her act upon it. When she does, miracles can happen.</p>

  <p class="extc" id="d12e1155"><i>In a marriage especially, “thoughtless words cut like a sword” (Proverbs 12:18 NIRV).</i></p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1158">In many cases, couples report that the Crazy Cycle grinds to a screeching halt. And more often than not, this change is triggered by the wife as she tries to give her husband unconditional respect. As a wife gets used to the idea of respecting her husband, she likes doing it and, of course, her husband is pleased also (after he gets over the shock). But most important, the husband is triggered to give his wife unconditional love. The lose-lose situation turns into a win-win, as the following letters from two much happier husbands indicate: One man who had attended numerous marriage seminars during twelve years of marriage wrote:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1160">While most marriage seminars concentrate on the husband’s need to love his wife unconditionally and sacrificially, few delve in any detail into the wife’s encouragement to respect her husband. Dr. Eggerichs understands this intrinsic need men have and how important the fulfillment of this need is to marriage communication. My wife and I heard things that explained why we “argue” and why we feel the way we feel. . . . I have never left a marriage seminar more excited and encouraged about my marriage.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1162">Another husband who had attended one of our conferences said:</p>

  <p class="ext" id="d12e1164">Having participated in several marriage seminars over the past seventeen years, I was not anticipating any earth-shattering or thought-provoking ideas. If anything, I expected the typical reproof commonly granted to men at these conferences. Instead, I walked away enlightened with a deeper sense of God’s design for men and women within the context of marriage. Rather than seeing our differences as deficiencies or reasons to divide, I began to appreciate and celebrate the uniqueness with which God has “wired” us. Although I was convicted of my shortcomings, I was also moved and inspired. I walked away encouraged and refreshed as I received a deeper understanding of who I am, and how that translates into my role as husband.</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1166">These men are among a growing number of husbands who are receiving respect and responding to their wives with positive understanding dialogue. And their wives are seeing that their husbands don’t have to “earn respect” any more than they don’t have to “earn love.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1169">But I have encountered many women for whom the words <i>unconditional respect</i> are a red flag. They have been bombarded for so long by the wrong interpretation of biblical submission that they are suspicious and even hostile toward the whole idea. “It will never work” . . . “It’s a man’s world” . . . “Unconditionally respecting men will just give them more power to grind us down.”</p>

  <p class="tx" id="d12e1174">I understand these concerns, but I respond that husbands who have goodwill toward their wives are not looking for ways to have power and superiority over them. On the contrary, many husbands don’t feel that powerful at all. Deep down they have a basic fear that can keep the Crazy Cycle spinning. As the next chapter will show, wives have far more power to change their marriage than many ever imagined.</p>
